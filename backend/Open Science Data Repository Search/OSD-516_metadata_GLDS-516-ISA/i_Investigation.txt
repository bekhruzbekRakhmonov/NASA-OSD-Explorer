Study Title	Modeling cellular responses to serum and vitamin D in microgravity using a human kidney microphysiological system
Study Description	The microgravity environment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) provides a unique stressor that can help understand underlying cellular and molecular drivers of pathological changes observed in astronauts with the ultimate goals of developing strategies to enable long- term spaceflight and better treatment of diseases on Earth. We used this unique environment to evaluate the effects of microgravity on kidney proximal tubule epithelial cell (PTEC) response to serum exposure and vitaminD biotransformation capacity. To test if microgravity alters the pathologic response of the proximal tubule to serum exposure, we treated PTECs cultured in a microphysiological system (PT-MPS) with human serum and measured biomarkers of toxicity and inflammation (KIM-1 and IL-6) and conducted global transcriptomics via RNAseq on cells undergoing flight (microgravity) and respective controls(ground). Given the profound bone loss observed in microgravity and PTECs produce the active form of vitamin D, we treated 3D cultured PTECs with 25(OH)D 3 (vitamin D) and monitored vitamin D metabolite formation, conducted global transcriptomics via RNAseq, and evaluated transcript expression of CYP27B1, CYP24A1, or CYP3A5 in PTECs undergoing flight (microgravity) and respective ground controls. We demonstrated that microgravity neither altered PTEC metabolism of vitamin D nor did it induce a unique response of PTECs to human serum, suggesting that these fundamental biochemical pathways in the kidney proximal tubule are not significantly altered by short-term exposure to microgravity. Given the prospect of extended spaceflight, more study is needed to determine if these responses are consistent with extended (greater than 6 months) exposure to microgravity.

Study Protocol Description	Cell culture: Deidentified human cortical kidney samples were collected through the Northwest Biotrust at the University of Washington Medical Center with local IRB approval (UW IRB Study 1297). Primary human proximal tubule epithelial cells were isolated by mechanical and enzymatic dissociation and cultured as previously described. Serum-free tubular cell cultures were maintained in PTEC maintenance media consisting of DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 11330-032) supplemented with 1× insulin-transferrin-selenium-sodium pyruvate (ITS-A, Gibco, 51300044), 50 nM hydrocortisone (Sigma, H6909), and 1× Antibiotic–Antimycotic (Gibco, 15240062). Upon reaching 70–80% confluence, PTECs were passaged by enzymatic digestion with 0.05% trypsin EDTA (Gibco, 25200056) and manual cell scraping to obtain a single-cell suspension that was subsequently neutralized with defined trypsin inhibitor (Gibco, R007100). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 200 × g for 6 min, resuspended in maintenance media, and plated in cell culture-treated flasks at greater than 30% confluency. PTECs were used at passage number 2–3 from all donors in these experiments. Microphysiological devices: Triplex microfluidic devices were purchased from Nortis, Inc. (Bothell, WA) and prepared as previously described. Triplex microfluidic devices contain three fluidic circuits, which enable the generation of three PTEC tubules on a single device that can be continuously perfused with media.	The BioServe perfusion platform was developed to house three Triplex devices in a self-contained, hermetically sealed system to meet the levels of containment required by NASA and reduce the space required to perfuse the Triplex devices. A flow rate of 0.5 µL/min was used for cell maintenance and treatment. The treatment conditions were control (PTEC maintenance media), vitamin D, or 2% human serum. After delivery and installation on board the ISS, cells were acclimated to microgravity for 6 days. Maintenance media cassettes were switched to treatment media cassettes containing either maintenance media, 2% human serum, or 3 µM vitamin D binding protein (DBP) + 1.5 µM vitamin D (25(OH)D3) and treated for 48 h prior to fixation with either RNA later for RNAseq or formalin. Ground controls were conducted using minute-to-minute time matching with on-station timing, with a 36 h delay. To prepare 2% human serum treatment media, normal human serum (Valley Biomedical, HS1021) was diluted in PTEC maintenance media to a final concentration of 2%. Vitamin D treatment media consisted of PTEC maintenance media supplemented with 1.5 µM 25(OH)D3 (Toronto Research Chemicals, C125700) and 3 µM DBP (Athens Research, 16-16-070307). To prepare vitamin D treatment media, stock 25(OH)D3 was solubilized with molecular biology grade ethanol to 5 mM. DBP was reconstituted to 3 µM in PTEC maintenance media to create PTEC-DBP media. 25(OH)D3 was then diluted into PTEC-DBP media to 1.5 µM. Vitamin D media was allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 30 min prior to filling the treatment cassette to ensure binding of 25(OH)D3 to DBP. The final concentration of ethanol in the vitamin D treatment media was 0.02%.	In order to preserve the tubules at the end of treatment for analyses, the devices were fixed for 2 h with RNALater (ThermoFisher, AM7024) at a flow rate of 10 µL/min.	RNA was isolated from devices fixed with RNALater by injecting 100 µL of RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen, 79216) into the injection port using a 1 mL syringe outfitted with a 22-gauge needle. The cell lysate was collected at the outlet, 400 µL of RLT lysis buffer was added to each tube, and the samples were stored at −80 °C until extraction. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, 74004) and converted to cDNA with the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (Takara, 634891).	Sequencing libraries were constructed using the SMARTer ThruPlex DNA-Seq Kit (Takara, R400676).	Sequencing libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA).	Sequencing reads were aligned to GRCh38.p12 with reference transcriptome GENCODE human release 30 (with additional ERCC spike-in sequences) using STAR (v2.6.1d).	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 13-May-2024.
