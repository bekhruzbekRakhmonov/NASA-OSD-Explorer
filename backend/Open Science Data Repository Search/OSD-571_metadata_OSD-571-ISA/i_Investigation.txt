Study Title	SpaceX Inspiration4 Plasma Profiling: Proteomics, EVPs, Metabolomics, cfDNA Sequencing and cfRNA Sequencing
Study Description	The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission was a 3-day mission with four private astronauts to low Earth orbit that occurred in September 2021. The crew collected biospecimen samples before, during, and after flight. One of these biospecimens was plasma from venous blood, which was collected pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) and post-flight (R+1, R+45, R+82). Plasma was collected via three methods: cell-free DNA blood collection tubes (cfDNA BCTs), cell processing tubes (CPTs) and via Ficoll separation from K2 EDTA tubes. Plasma from cfDNA BCTs was used to isolate cfDNA for sequencing. Plasma from CPTs was used for proteomics. Plasma from the K2 EDTA tubes was used for metabolomics and to isolate extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) for mass spectrometry. Differential protein and metabolite abundances were calculated pre vs post-flight to generate processed data files.

Study Protocol Description	cfDNA was extracted using Qiagen’s QIAamp ccfDNA/RNA Kit per manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in 15 uL Qiagen Elution Buffer per sample.	Entire extract volume was used as input for library preparation using NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Preparation Kit for cfDNA protocol, which skips the fragmentation step. Each sample was barcoded using NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (Unique Dual Index UMI Adaptors - 96 reactions) per manufacturer’s instructions. Final library was eluted in 30uL and checked for concentration using Thermo Fisher Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay (cat  Q33231). 0.25 pmol of each sample was then shipped to Element Biosciences for sequencing. Each library was circularized individually with an input range of 0.2-0.5 pmol (30 ul of 6.67-16.67nM) based on linear library yields using Adept Library Compatibility Kit (Element Biosciences, Cat  830-00003).	Circular libraries were pooled into 2 separate 4-plex pools. Each 4-plex pool was denatured and sequenced on Element AVITI system (Element Biosciences, Part  88-00001) using 2x147 paired reads with 19bp UMI/index 1 and 8 bp index 2. Primary analysis was performed onboard the AVITI sequencing instrument.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.	Plasma samples were thawed on ice and EVPs were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation, as previously described. Briefly, samples were centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 20 minutes to remove microvesicles, then EVPs were collected by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman Coulter Optima XE or XPE ultracentrifuge at 100,000 x g for 70 minutes. EVPs were then washed in PBS and pelleted again by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 70 minutes. The final EVP pellet was resuspended in PBS.	EVP samples were dried by vacuum centrifugation and re-dissolved in 30-50 µL 8M Urea/50 mM am​​monium bicarbonate/10 mM DTT. Following lysis and reduction, proteins were alkylated using 20 or 30 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma). Proteins were digested with Endopeptidase Lys C (Wako) in less than 4M urea followed by trypsinization (Promega) in less than 2M Urea. Peptides were desalted and concentrated using Empore C18-based solid phase extraction prior to analysis by high resolution/high mass accuracy reversed phase (C18) nano-LC-MS/MS. Typically, 30% of each sample was injected. Peptides were separated on a pulled-emitter column using a 90-minute gradient increasing from 2 to 30% buffer B/buffer A (buffer A: 0.1% formic acid in water, buffer B: 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile). Samples were analyzed on Q-Exactive HF LC-MS/MS instrument (Thermo Scientific) operated in data dependent (DDA) positive ion mode.	High resolution/high mass accuracy nano-LC-MS/MS data was processed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4.1.14 (Thermo-Scientific, 2012)/ Mascot 2.5, as previously reported25. Human data was queried against the UniProt’s Complete HUMAN proteome (February, 2020: 74,790 sequences) using the following parameters: Enzyme: Trypsin/P, maximum allowed missed cleavage sites: 2, monoisotopic precursor mass tolerance: 10 ppm, monoisotopic fragment mass tolerance: 0.02 Da, dynamic modifications: Oxidation (M), Acetyl (Protein N-term), static modification: Carbamidomethyl (C). Percolator was used to calculate peptide False Discovery Rates (FDR), which was calculated per file. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% was applied to each separate LC-MS/MS file. For plasma, the sequences of porcine trypsin and Endopeptidase LysC were concatenated to the human databases. After processing, the “limma” R package (version 3.52) was used, taking into account estimated sample weights and including astronaut as a factor in the model.	cfRNA was extracted using Norgen's Plasma/Serum Circulating and Exosomal RNA Purification Kits (Slurry Format). Extracted RNA was DNase treated with 14 mL of 10 mL DNase Turbo Buffer (AM2238, Invitrogen), 3 mL DNase Turbo (AM2238, Invitrogen), 1mL Baseline Zero DNase (DB0715K, Lucigen-Epicenter) for 30 min at 37C and then concentrated into 12 mL using the Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrate Kit (R1015, Zymo).	Sequencing libraries were constructed from 8 mL of concentrated RNA using the Takara SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v3 – Pico Input Mammalian (634485, Takara). Briefly, extracted RNA was reverse transcribed using random priming, barcoded using the SMARTer RNA Unique Dual Index Kit (634451, Takara), rRNA depleted, and further amplified. Final library was eluted in 20uL and concentration was quantified using a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Q33216, Invitrogen) with the dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Q32854, Invitrogen).	Libraries were pooled to equal concentration and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2K P3 using 2x61 paired reads.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.	250 µL of each sample was transferred to Seer Sample Tubes for processing with the Proteograph Assay kit (S55R1100). Plasma proteins were quantitatively captured in nanoparticle (NP) associated protein coronas. To this end, 5 distinctly functionalized NP comprising superparamagnetic cores were employed. At equilibrium, NPs synergistically captured physicochemical subsets of the proteome and efficiently compress the high dynamic range of protein abundances to an accessible scale. The superparamagnetic core facilitates a fully automated liquid handling process. Proteins were subsequently denatured, reduced, alkylated and subjected to proteolytic digestion (trypsin and Lysc). Peptides were purified and yields were determined (Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog   23290). Peptides were dried down overnight with a vacuum concentrator and reconstituted with a reconstitution buffer to a concentration of 25 or 50 ng/µL, depending on nanoparticle (NP) peptide preparation.	For Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA), 4 µL of reconstituted peptide mixture from each NP preparation was analyzed resulting in a constant mass MS injection between samples (200 ng: NP1, NP2, NP3, and NP5; 100 ng: NP4). Each sample was analyzed with an UltiMate3000 nanoLC system coupled with a Bruker timsTOF Pro mass spectrometer using a trap-and-elute configuration. First, the peptides were loaded onto an Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 (0.3 mm ID x 5 mm) trap column and then separated on a 50 cm µPACTM analytical column (PharmaFluidics, Belgium) at a flow rate of 1 µL/min using a gradient of 5 – 25% solvent B (0.1% formic acid, 100 % acetonitrile) mixed into solvent A (0.1% formic acid, 100% water) over 22 min, resulting in a 33 min total run time. The mass spectrometer was operated in diaPASEF mode using ion mobility range of 0.57 – 1.47 V*s/cm2, TIMS Ramp of 100 ms and 100 ms TIMS accumulation time. Scan ranges were 100-1700 m/z (MS1) and 400-1000 m/z (MS2). One-hundred fixed window MS2 DIA scans were collected per cycle.	DIA data was processed using ProteographTM Analysis Suite (PAS). Raw MS data was processed using the DIA-NN search engine (version 1.8), searching MS/MS spectra against human protein entries (UP000005640_9606) and a human plasma spectral library generated from DDA runs (62,687 precursors and 4,011 protein groups). MS1 and MS2 mass accuracy was set to 10 ppm. Precursor FDR was set to 0.01, and PG Q value was set to 0.01. Quantiﬁcation was performed on summed abundances of all unique peptides considering only precursors passing the q-value cutoff. PAS summarizes all nanoparticle values for a single protein into a single quantitative value. Specifically, a single protein may have been measured up to five times, once for each nanoparticle. To derive the single measurement value, PAS uses a maximum representation approach, whereby the single quantification value for a particular peptide or protein group represents the quantitation value of the NP most frequently measured across all samples. Technical duplicates (2 per sample) were first averaged and the average was used for downstream analysis. Protein groups were filtered by coefficient of variance (CV), keeping only proteins with CV less than 0.5 in at least one time point and by data sparsity, keeping proteins that have no NAs in with at least one condition. The filtered data was normalized with “vsn” normalization and imputed with random draws from a Gaussian distribution centered around a minimal value. Differential gene expression analysis was performed with “limma” R package (version 3.52), taking into account estimated sample weights and including astronaut as a factor in the model.	All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. We sequenced analyzed samples before and after a 3-day mission to space.	For proteomics of blood plasma: Venous whole blood was collected into cell processing tubes (CPTs) (BD Biosciences:  362753). CPTs were spun at 1800 x g for 30 minutes. Plasma was aliquoted and frozen at -80C. For proteomics of blood extracellular vesicles and particles (EVPs) and blood plasma metabolome: Venous whole blood was collected into K2 EDTA tubes (BD Biosciences:  367844).  Blood was centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 minutes, then plasma was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 20 minutes, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80C. For cfDNA and cfRNA sequencing: Venous whole blood was collected into cell-free DNA blood collection tubes (cfDNA BCTs) (Streck:  230470). Tubes were spun at 300 x g for 20 minutes. Plasma was transferred to a fresh tube and centrifuged at 5000 x g for 10 minutes. Plasma was aliquoted and frozen at -80C.	To survey a broad range of potential changes in plasma metabolite levels, acquired plasma were extracted for LC/MS-based metabolite profiling using  a combination of aqueous normal phase (ANP)  and reverse phase (RP) chromatographic separations, followed by positive- and negative-ion MS analysis. For ANP LC/MS metabolite profiling, plasma metabolites were extracted by addition of 1 parts of plasma to 20 parts 70% acetonitrile in ddH2O (vol:vol).  The mixture was briefly vortexed and then centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 x g to pellet precipitated matter. The resulting supernatant was transferred to sample vials and 4 µl was injected for ANP LC/MS metabolite profiling. For RP LC/MS metabolite profiling, extraction of plasma was carried out using -70°C cold methanol, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and water. For this purpose, 8 µL of plasma was added to 180 µL of the cold methanolic extraction media in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and briefly vortexed. This was followed by addition of 600µL ice-cold MTBE to the tube, with intermittent vortex and shaking on ice for 6 min. Phase separation was induced by adding 150 µl of LC-MS-grade H2O to the methanol/MTBE extracts. The final mixture was vortexed again, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min at 4°C. The upper phase was transferred to clean tubes, dried down and stored at -80°C until the day of analysis. On the day of LC/MS analysis, dried down metabolites were resolubilized in 100 µl of a solution consisting of 36% acetonitrile, 36% isopropyl alcohol, 28% H2O, 0.1% formic acid, and 5 mM ammonium formate (i.e., 3:2 volume ratio of LC mobile phases A and B). The resulting reconstitute was briefly vortexed and centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 rpm. Supernatants were transferred to LC sample vials and a 4 µl volume was injected for RP LC/MS analysis using both positive and negative ion MS detection modes as detailed below.	LC/MS analysis of sample extracts was performed using a platform comprised of an Agilent Model 1290 liquid chromatography system coupled to an Agilent 6550 iFunnel time-of-flight MS analyzer28–30. Chromatographic separation of metabolites was performed using both ANP and RP gradient separations, as noted above. For ANP chromatography, plasma metabolites were separated on a Diamond Hydride column (4 µm, 100A, 150 mm X 21 mm ID; MicroSolv Technology Corp.). Mobile phases consisted of: (A) 50% isopropanol, containing 0.025% acetic acid, and (B) 90% acetonitrile containing 5 mM ammonium acetate. To eliminate the interference of metal ions on chromatographic peak integrity and electrospray ionization, EDTA was added to the mobile phase at a final concentration of 5 μM. The following gradient was applied: 0–1.0 min, 99% B; 1.0–20.0 min, to 0%B; 20.0 to 29.0, 0% B; 29.1 to 37 min, 99%B. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min and column temperature was maintained at 25°C.  For RP chromatography, plasma lipids were preferentially separated using an Agilent Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 column( 1.8 µm, 100 × 2.1 mm ID, Agilent Technologies). Mobile phases consisted of: (A) 60:40 (v/v) acetonitrile:water containing 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1 % formic acid, and (B) 90:10 (v/v) isopropanol:acetonitrile containing 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1 % formic acid. The following gradient was applied: 0 min: 15% B; 0–2 min to 30% B, 2–2.5 min to 48% B, 2.5–8.5 min to 72% B, 8.5–11.5 min to 99% B,11.5–12 min to 99% B, 12.1–15 min 15% B. The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min with a column temperature of 60°C. To eliminate potential artifacts owing to LC/MS instrument drift, metabolite instability, and other experimental factors that may contribute to systematic error, the sample run sequence was arranged such that no two consecutively analyzed samples came from either the same patient or were from the same blood sampling date.	Raw LC/MS data were extracted using MassProfinder 8.0 (Agilent Technologies), employing an in-house annotated personal metabolite database comprising 865 metabolites for ANP chromatography and  270 lipid metabolite  RP database curated from the Agilent plasma lipidomic database (https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/applications/application-LCMS-Plasma-Lipid-Analysis-Method-ZORBAX-Jet-Stream-5991-9280EN-agilent.pdf.pdf). Metabolite identities were inferred based on accurate mass and retention time matches of database. Confidence levels for metabolite annotations were indicated on a 1-4 scale, in accord with guidelines from the Lipidomics Standard Initiative (https://lipidomics-standards-initiative.org/). Relative abundance of extracted metabolites in units of ion counts was exported for downstream statistical analysis. Metabolites with over 20% missing values and samples with over 10% missing values were filtered out. We performed probabilistic quotient normalization to correct for sample-wise variation and then log2 scaled the data. To remove outliers, we removed measurements with less than 2.5% two-tailed probability to originate from the same normal distribution as the rest of the measurement values, after applying a Bonferroni-inspired correction factor (division by sample size).  Metabolites with over 20% missing values were filtered again, and missing values were then imputed using a k-nearest-neighbor algorithm. After processing, the “limma” R package (version 3.52) was used, taking into account estimated sample weights and including astronaut as a factor in the model.
