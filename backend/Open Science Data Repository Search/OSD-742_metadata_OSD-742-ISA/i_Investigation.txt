Study Title	Metagenome profiling of feces from mice flown on the RRRM-1 mission
Study Description	In Rodent Research Reference Mission-1 (RRRM-1), forty female BALB/cAnNTac mice were flown on the International Space Station. To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 10-12 week-old and twenty 32 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 22-23 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 40 days and allowed to recover for 2 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice sacrificed 1 day after launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-1 included a total of 160 mice. Feces were removed from 145 animals and preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 ËšC until DNA was extracted, and libraries generated and sequenced (target 10 M clusters per sample, PE 251 bp). This dataset features whole-genome shotgun metagenomics sequencing data from 8-10 feces samples per group.

Study Protocol Description	In the Rodent Research Reference Mission (RRRM-1), forty female BALB/cAnNTac mice were flown on the International Space Station. To assess differences in outcomes due to age, twenty 10-12 week-old and twenty 32 week-old mice were flown, respectively. To directly assess spaceflight effects, half of the young and old mice (10 old, 10 young) were sacrificed on-orbit after 22-23 days (ISS Terminal, ISS-T), while the other half (10 old, 10 young) were returned live to Earth after 40 days and allowed to recover for 2 days (Live Animal Return, LAR) before sacrifice. Both the ISS-T and LAR animals had independent ground controls (10 mice housed in flight hardware in matched environmental conditions), basal controls (10 mice sacrificed 1 day after launch), and vivarium controls (10 mice housed within standard vivarium habitats). Thus RRRM-1 included a total of 160 mice. All mice (BALB/cAnNTac) were sourced from Taconic Biosciences (Germantown, NY). Mice were weighed, chipped with BMDS RFID chip (IMI-500) and shipped to NASA KSC for delivery at approximately L-4 weeks. Mice were housed and maintained in the Animal Care Facility (ACF) at NASA KSC with 12:12 light cycle matched in timing to the light cycle used for Transporters and Habitats programmed for flight. All mice were housed in cages of 5 mice/cage with the same littermates as they had been raised. Mice were initially given ad lib standard lab chow and water, which was changed on a schedule of 2x per week. Mice were housed initially on standard bedding and provided igloo-type enrichment. Animal health was checked daily by appropriately trained NASA personnel and contracted lab technicians. At L-3 weeks, mice were placed on raised mesh flooring to simulate spaceflight Transporter and Habitat cage conditions, given water delivered through lixits identical to those used in the flight hardware and put on the NASA Nutrient-Upgraded Rodent Foodbars (NuRFB). Food and water was changed weekly and mice were weighed bi-weekly. Igloo-type enrichment was provided in all cages. At L-10 days, mice were grouped (10 mice per cage) in larger cages for social acclimation prior to launch. Groupings were done based on age of animals and with regard to establishing similar average weights between any given grouping. At L-2 days, baseline, spaceflight and ground control groups were identified. At L-1 day, spaceflight animals were loaded into spaceflight Transporters. Habitat Ground Control (HGC) mice were loaded into Transporters on a 3-day offset from spaceflight animals. Vivarium Ground Control (VGC) mice (also on a 3-day offset) were returned to 5 mice/cage and placed on standard bedding and provided water through typical sipper tubes at launch equivalent. All mice were maintained on NuRFB throughout the duration of the study. Spaceflight and HGC mice were given new food at weekly intervals. VGC mice were given new food and fresh water also on weekly intervals. Mold contamination of food: Spaceflight and Habitat Ground Control mice were exposed to mold in their food to unknown relative degrees. The Vivarium Control and Baseline Control mice had clean food throughout their habitation. Loose food bars: Food bars came loose and fell to the bottom of the cage for the HGC mice and was free floating for the Spaceflight mice. This did not prevent the mice from eating. This may have caused some degree of stress for these animals that would have been experienced differently between the Spaceflight and HGC groups. Live animal return: Because weather in the Pacific was very poor, mice experienced double density housing (10 per cage instead of 5) for at least 7 days instead of the expected 2-3 days. Habitat Ground Control mice were treated the same way but this duration of double-density housing probably created additional stress on both groups of mice. In addition, because of rough seas, the Spaceflight mice might have experienced some sea sickness-type conditions that would not have been experienced by the HGC mice. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). GeneLab only processed 68 and 77 samples from LAR and ISS-T groups, respectively, in this dataset for a total of 145 processed samples.	Live Animal Return (LAR) samples: Mice were anesthetized with gas anesthesia and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. Fecal samples and other tissues were removed and preserved using liquid nitrogen after euthanasia. All groups (baseline, flight, habitat and vivarium ground controls) were treated identically. All samples were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage during transportation and shipment. ISS Terminal (ISS-T) samples: Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and euthanized by means of cardiac puncture blood draw (exsanguination) and double thoracotomy. The carcass was then wrapped in foil and frozen in MELFI on board the ISS or in ground -80C freezers. Carcasses were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage on board the ISS, in ground freezers and during transportation and shipment. For fecal sample collection, carcasses were thawed at room temperature one at a time (staggered) until the tissues were sufficiently pliable for dissection (approximately 60-90 minutes). Once thawed, tissues were removed from each carcass and preserved using liquid nitrogen. All samples were maintained at -80C or lower temperatures throughout the storage in ground freezers and during transportation and shipment.	DNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC Purefood GMO and Authentication Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following GeneLab SOP 3.3 Feces DNA Extraction using Maxwell RSC instrument with PureFood GMO kit. 0.5-2 fecal pellet(s) (based on amount in tube and mass of pellet range 10-15 mg) was/were placed into a tube with 1 mL CTAB solution and homogenized using tissue homogenizing bead mix (Navy RINO Lysis, Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) on Bullet Blender Gold 24 (Next Advance, Raymertown, NY) for 3 minutes at 4 ËšC following GeneLab SOP 2.1 Tissue homogenization using Bullet Blender Bead Beater. Homogenates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4 ËšC and 21,000 g to deflate foam. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate and purify DNA following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was eluted in 60-140 ÂµL RNAse free H2O (60-120 used for LAR sample extraction in 2023 because of low DNA yield, higher DNA yield in 2024 resulted in use of 130-140 uL H2O) and was further cleaned using OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Concentrations for all DNA samples were measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with Qubit DNA HS kit following SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. DNA quality and size were assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with Agilent gDNA ScreenTape Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 4.2 QC Genomic DNA. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.	DNA library was prepared with the Illumina DNA Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab. Input DNA were approximately 100-500 ng. All libraries (Preps 2-5) were prepared entirely on the epMotion, except for Prep 1, for which the epMotion had an error and the library cleanup step was done manually. Index adapters were IDT for Illumina, 96-well DNA Dual Index Adapters, set C, and Nextera DNA UD Indexes, Plate C. 5 cycles PCR were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP 6.3 Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeStation System with D1000 reagent kit. For all prep batches except for Prep 1, the average library fragment sizes were assessed as being too large (~700 to greater than 900 bp), and several manual cleanups (0.4-0.6x bead:sample ratios on a few samples were tested, 0.55x ratio used for most samples) were performed to correct library size to a sequencable range (average of 641 bp). Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit 4 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) following GeneLab SOP 4.1-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quantification using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Libraries were pooled and balanced based on read count. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.	DNA sequencing was performed by GeneLab Sample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as following: Read 1: 251 bp, Index1: 10 bp, Index2: 10 bp Read 2: 251 bp. PhiX included as control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP 7.1-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers. GeneLab Sample Processing SOP can be found at the GitHub page, https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab-sampleProcessing/tree/master/SOP_docs.	Human reads were identified and removed from the raw data as described in GL-DPPD-7105-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Remove_human_reads_from_raw_data/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7105_Versions/GL-DPPD-7105-A.md). In short, human reads were identified and removed from the raw data using kraken2 (v2.1.1) against a human genome reference database that was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13. The database was constructed by running kraken build with the following parameters: --no-masking, kmer-length 35, and minimizer-length 31.	Non-human reads were assessed for the percent mouse reads as described in GL-DPPD-7109 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Metagenomics/Estimate_host_reads_in_raw_data/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7109_Versions/GL-DPPD-7109.md). In short, mouse reads were classified and quantitated from the non-human reads using kraken2 (v2.1.1) against a mouse genome reference database that was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001635.27) GRCm39. The database was constructed by running kraken build with the following parameters: --no-masking, kmer-length 35, and minimizer-length 31.	Human reads removed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.17) was used to generate MultiQC reports.
