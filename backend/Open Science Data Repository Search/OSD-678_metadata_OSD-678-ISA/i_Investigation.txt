Study Title	Light has a principal role in the Arabidopsis transcriptomic response to the spaceflight environment
Study Description	The Characterizing Arabidopsis Root Attractions (CARA) spaceflight experiment provides comparative transcriptome analyses of plants grown in both light and dark conditions within the same spaceflight. CARA compared three genotypes of Arabidopsis grown in ambient light and in the dark on board the International Space Station (ISS); Col-0, Ws, and phyD, a phytochrome D mutant in the Col-0 background. In all genotypes, leaves responded to spaceflight with a higher number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than root tips, and each genotype displayed distinct light / dark transcriptomic patterns that were unique to the spaceflight environment. The Col-0 leaves exhibited a substantial dichotomy, with ten-times as many spaceflight DEGs exhibited in light-grown plants versus dark-grown plants. Although the total number of DEGs in phyD leaves is not very different from Col-0, phyD altered the manner in which light-grown leaves respond to spaceflight, and many genes associated with the physiological adaptation of Col-0 to spaceflight were not represented. This result is in contrast to root tips, where a previous CARA study showed that phyD substantially reduced the number of DEGs. There were few DEGs, but a series of space-altered gene categories, common to genotypes and lighting conditions. This commonality indicates that key spaceflight genes are associated with signal transduction for light, defense, and oxidative stress responses. However, these key signaling pathways enriched from DEGs showed opposite regulatory direction in response to spaceflight under light and dark conditions, suggesting a complex interaction between light as a signal, and light-signaling genes in acclimation to spaceflight.

Study Protocol Description	Three lines of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) including two wild-types, Columbia-0 (Col-0) and Wassilewskija (Ws), and a Col-0 PHYD mutant (phyD, SALK_027956C), were grown in phytagel plates on orbit or at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) within the ISS Environment Simulator (ISSES) Chamber for 11 days. Six plates were used for each genotype and 11 seedlings were planted in each plate. Seedlings were grown in the ambient, diffuse light (4–6 μmol m–2 s−1) of the ISS cabin wall, or in the dark (plates were unwrapped for 4 h to activate germination, then re-wrapped by black-out cloth, which were also affixed to the wall). The ground control in the ISSES (ISS Environmental Simulation) chamber of KSC were performed 24 h later than spaceflight samples, allowing the manipulation of lighting and atmospheric composition for the ISSES to mimic the conditions that plants were experiencing on the ISS.	The 11-day old plants were harvested into RNAlater in Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) and kept for 12–18 h at ambient temperature to ensure perfusion before being transferred to the MELFI freezer for storage on orbit. The KFTs were also kept frozen in transit to Earth and KSC, and during the transportation back to UF Space Plants Lab.	Seedlings frozen in RNAlater were thawed at 4 °C and then leaf tissues were dissected from the hypocotyl using a dissecting microscope and collected. The plants used in this study were from the same plates as those used for the collection of root tips in OSD-120. All leaves from one plate were pooled for RNA extraction, thus one plate comprised a biological replicate. RNA extraction was conducted using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, USA).	Three biological replicates were used for RNA-seq. RNA samples were multiplexed and sequenced in the NovaSeq 6000 platform with 2 × 150 bp reads at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR), University of Florida, including Core of Gene Expression and Genotyping (RRID:SCR_019145) for library construction and Core of NextGen DNA sequencing (RRID:SCR_019152) for sequencing.

More than 60 million paired-end reads were obtained per library.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of A-thaliana rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 13-May-2024.
