Study Title	Predicting how varying moisture conditions impact the microbiome of dust collected from the International Space Station (ISS)
Study Description	On Earth, people spend 90% of their time indoors where dust and moisture can facilitate rapid microbial growth, especially fungi. The International Space Station is a specialized closed environment that contains own unique indoor microbiome. Elevated moisture such as from a temporary ventilation system malfunction may lead to unintended microbial growth indoors, which is associated with negative health outcomes and degradation of essential built environment materials. We need to develop a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth to understand when it may occur in these critical indoor spaces. Here we demonstrate that exposure to even fluctuating elevated relative humidity above 80% can lead to rapid microbial growth and community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We were able to model fungal growth in space station dust using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity conditions, respectively. Alpha and beta diversity of fungi was altered with both significantly decreasing as relative humidity and time elevated increased. Our results demonstrate that we can use moisture conditions to develop predictive models for fungal growth and composition. Understanding microbial growth in spacecraft can protect astronaut health, spacecraft integrity, and promote planetary protection as human activity increases in low-Earth orbit, the moon, Mars, and beyond.

Study Protocol Description	DNA was extracted from 25 mg dust samples before and after incubations using a DNeasy Powerlyzer Power Soil Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a modified bead mixture (1 g garnet, 0.3 g 100 µm glass beads, and 0.1 g 500 µm beads). Each DNA extraction run included a blank and confirmed to contain no microbial DNA. A total of 50 µL of DNA extract was collected for each sample and stored at -20℃ until use.	Amplicon library preparation used the standard two-step approach recommended by Illumina for generating libraries and was performed by RTL Genomics (Lubbock, TX, USA). Fungal primers: ITS1F (CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and ITS2aR (GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC). ribosomal DNA primers - Bacterial primers: 515F (5’-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTA) and 806R (5’-GGACTACHVHHHTWTCTAAT).	All sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq (TM) using a read length of 2 x 300 base pairs.	- Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology 2 (QIIME2), version 2021.8, was used to analyze raw FASTQ sequencing data For fungal sequences: - Primers and spacers were trimmed using the Cutadapt plug-in - Paired-ends joined using the VSEARCH join-pairs method - Sequences were trimmed to a Phred score of 30 with a 3 low-quality base window using the Quality-filter plugin - Sequences were clustered using the vsearch open reference method with Unite database reference sequences (version 9.0) - The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) version 2.9.0, User-friendly Nordic Internal Transcribed spacer Ectomycorrhiza (UNITE) 2019 database, and Fungal High-throughput Taxonomic tool for use with Next-Generation Sequencing (FHitINGS) version 1.4 were used to identify fungal taxonomy For bacterial sequences: - Sequences were run through the Dada2 pipeline - Sequences were clustered by phylogeny - Bacterial taxa was classified in QIIME2 using the feature-classifier plugin which utilized the Greengenes database version 13_8	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.	"ISS Dust Samples: All dust used in this study was obtained from vacuum bags (CELOC hypoallergenic filter system Oreck  PKBB12DW) from the vacuum onboard the ISS which astronauts use to clean the HEPA filter coverings that are part of the air ventilation system. It is important to note that we had no control of when, how much, or where these vacuums were used while onboard, which means other areas may have also been vacuumed in addition to the HEPA filter coverings. In total, ISS dust from 4 separate vacuum bags were returned to Earth and analyzed in this study. ISS vacuum bags 1-4 were collected by the ISS crew on GMT 264 (September 21, 2018), GMT 102 (April 12, 2019), GMT 243 (August 31, 2019), and GMT 286 (October 13, 2019) and returned to Earth on SpaceX16 (January 13, 2019), SpaceX-17 (July 3, 2019), and SpaceX-19 (January 7, 2020). In total, it took approximately 6, 5, 6, and 4 months for bags 1, 2, 3, and 4 to reach our lab at OSU from the actual collection date onboard ISS. For ISS vacuum bag 1, the full vacuum bag was sent directly to The Ohio State University Indoor Environmental Quality Laboratory. ISS vacuum bags 2-4 were first sent to the Toxicology and Environmental Chemistry group at NASA’s Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX, USA) and then a subsample of dust was sent to us for analyses. In addition, we received dust samples which were frozen onboard the ISS, returned in cold stowage, and sent directly to our laboratory, where they were stored at -80°C until use.

Incubations: All incubation were completed in a sterilized 3.8 L glass chamber and placed in a VWR incubator (Model TFFU20F2QWA Radnor, PA USA) set to 25°C. Sodium chloride (NaCl) and Magnesium Chloride (MgCl2) solutions were used to simulate 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, and 90% ERH conditions. Deionized (DI) water alone was used to create 100% ERH conditions. Salt solutions were measured for water activity (aw) using an Aqualab™ Dew Point Water Activity Meter (Decagon 125 Devices Pullman, WA USA) and adjusted as needed. All incubation chambers contained approximately 50 mL of salt solution or DI for the desired ERH condition and an Onset® HOBO® Data logger (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA USA) to monitor Equilibrium Relative Humidity (ERH) and temperature. Dust samples were not sieved and measure out into approximately 25 mg portions that were placed on sterile aluminum foil on a plastic dish. Two-week incubations consisted of triplicate samples for each ISS bag and ERH condition (3 samples from each bag per incubation chamber) similar to previous studies. Time-of-wetness incubations followed a procedure previously outlined. Time-of-wetness refers to the time fraction per day that relative humidity conditions are above the 80% threshold. This framework was applied to microbial growth in ISS dust by calculating the relative growth rates at days 5, 10, 14, and 21 at elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions which cycled between 50% ERH for 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours during separate incubations. To obtain the relative growth rate (R/k), we first calculated the growth rates (k) for constant (24 hours/day) elevated and saturated conditions. Next, the effective growth rates (R) were calculated for each condition (elevated and saturated) at 6-, 12-, and 18-hour time points. The relative growth rate was calculated for each bag at each time-of-wetness first, then these values were averaged to obtain the averaged maximum relative growth rate for each time point and ERH condition. Samples were extracted and quantified at days 5, 10, 14, and 21 after incubation (One 25 mg dust sample per day per bag). All incubation chambers were covered with parafilm to retain ERH conditions and allow CO2 to escape."
