Study Title	SpaceX Inspiration4 PBMC Profiling: snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and T-cell and B-cell repertoire profiling
Study Description	The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission was a 3-day mission with four private astronauts to low Earth orbit that occurred in September 2021. The crew collected biospecimen samples before and after flight. One of these biospecimen collections included PBMCs collected via venipuncture two 4mL K2 EDTA tubes (BD Biosciences, cat# 367844), collected pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) and post-flight (R+1, R+45, R+82). Single-nuclei RNA-seq and single-nuclei ATAC-seq were co-assayed using the 10X Genomics Multiome Kit (L-92, L-44, L-3, R+1, R+45, R+82 timepoints). T-cell and B-cell V(D)J repertoires were profiled using the 10X Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ Kit (L-3, R+1, R+45, R+82 timepoints).  Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina platform. Differential gene expression profiles and clonotypes detected per timepoint were calculated from sequencing results.

Study Protocol Description	Depletion of granulocytes was performed either directly from whole blood using the RosetteSep granulocyte depletion cocktail or by cell sorting after PBMC isolation. Whole blood was incubated in a granulocyte depletion cocktail (50 µL/mL of blood) for 20 minutes at room temperature. Next, Ficoll-Paque Plus (Cytiva) was utilized to isolate PBMCs by density gradient centrifugation. After washes in PBS with 2% FBS (GIBCO) were completed, isolated PBMCs were cell sorted to remove granulocytes only if the RosetteSep granulocyte depletion cocktail was not added to whole blood prior to density gradient centrifugation. Granulocytes were identified using side scatter and the lymphocyte and monocyte fractions were sorted using a 100 µm nozzle (BD Aria). Following granulocyte depletion, PBMCs were split into two fractions to generate single cell V(D)J T-cell and B-cell libraries or multi-omic (GEX and ATAC) libraries.	Prior to single cell multiome ATAC and gene expression sequencing, nuclei isolation was performed by resuspending PBMCs in 100 µL of cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1 % Tween-20, 0.1 % Nonidet P40, 0.01 % digitonin, 1 % BSA, 1 mM DTT and 1 U/µL RNAse inhibitor. Cells were incubated for 4 minutes on ice, followed by the addition of 1 mL cold wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1 % Tween-20, 1 % BSA, 0.1 % Tween-20, 1 mM DTT, 1 U/µl RNAse inhibitor). After centrifugation (500 RCF for 5 minutes at 4°C), nuclei were resuspended in diluted nuclei buffer (10X Genomics Single Cell Multiome ATAC kit A) at a concentration of 6,000 nuclei per µL.	Single-nuclei libraries were generated via the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC and Gene Expression kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer's instructions.	Samples were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000. ATAC libraries were sequenced with a 51-8-24-51 configuration.	The resulting single-nuclei GEX and single-nuclei ATAC-seq FASTQ files were aligned using the cellranger-arc pipeline from 10X genomics against human reference genome hg38. Quality control and cell annotation was performed on the snATAC seq peak-cell matrices, and the snGEX gene-cell matrices using the R Seurat package (version 4.2.0). Subpopulations were clustered and labeled using a publicly available Azimuth human PBMCs in conjunction with Seurat’s supervised clustering functionality. Differential gene expression analysis for labeled subpopulations was performed using the FindMarkers functionality of Seurat, with a log fold change (logFC) cutoff point of 0.25. P-values of resultant genes were measured using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and deemed significant for p less than 0.05. Differentially accessible regions for the labeled subpopulations were identified using the same method.	Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.11) was used to generate MultiQC reports. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.	To capture T-cell and B-cell V(D)J repertoire, single cell gel beads-in-emulsion and libraries were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5’ v2, 10x Genomics).	Samples were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000, paired end reads (151x2).	VDJ libraries were processed using Cell Ranger v6.1.1. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 human genome. TCR and BCR annotated data were analyzed with the VGenes package (https://github.com/WilsonImmunologyLab/VGenes).	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.	Samples were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000. Gene Expression (GEX) Libraries were sequenced with a 28-10-10-90 configuration.	All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. We sequenced analyzed samples before and after a 3-day mission to space.	For each crew member at each timepoint, 8 mL of venous blood was collected in K2 EDTA anticoagulant tubes  (BD Biosciences:  367844). Samples were processed immediately after collection.
