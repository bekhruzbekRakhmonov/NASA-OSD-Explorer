Study Identifier	OSD-683
Study Title	Response of Staphylococcus aureus physiology and Agr quorum sensing to low shear modelled microgravity
Study Description	Staphylococcus aureus is commonly isolated from astronauts returning from spaceflight missions. Previous analysis of BRIC-23 omics data generated from S. aureus low Earth orbit cultures indicated significantly increased expression of the Agr quorum sensing system and its downstream targets in spaceflight samples compared to ground controls. In this current study, the rotary cell culture system (RCCS) was used to investigate the effect of low shear modelled microgravity (LSMMG) on S. aureus physiology and Agr activity. When cultured in BRIC-23 medium and temperature conditions, S. aureus LSMMG cultures exhibited decreased agr expression and altered growth compared to normal gravity control cultures, which are typically oriented with gas permeable membrane on bottom of the high aspect rotating vessel (HARV). However, when grown in an inverted gravity control orientation (membrane on top of the HARV), reduced Agr activity was observed relative to both traditional control and LSMMG cultures, signifying that oxygen availability may affect the observed differences in agr expression. Metabolite assays revealed increased lactate and decreased acetate excretion in both LSMMG and inverted control cultures. Secretomics analysis of LSMMG, control, and inverted control HARV culture supernatants corroborated these results, with inverted and LSMMG cultures exhibiting decreased abundance of Agr-regulated virulence factors and increased abundance of low-oxygen metabolic proteins. Collectively, these studies suggest that orientation of the HARV gas permeable membrane can affect S. aureus physiology and Agr quorum sensing in the RCCS, a variable that should be considered when interpreting data using this ground-based microgravity model.

Study Protocol Description	Collected cell-free supernatant samples were subsequently thawed on ice, then 2400 µL of each filtered supernatant was split into two 1200 µL aliquots, both of which were transferred into their own sterile 1.8 mL tubes. A 300 µL volume of 100% trichloroacetic acid was then added to each tube, and samples were incubated for 30 minutes at 4°C. Samples were then centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 5 minutes, and the supernatants were discarded. Protein pellets were resuspended in 200 µL of cold acetone, and the acetone washes from both aliquots of each sample were combined. Samples were centrifuged again as described above, and the acetone wash was repeated for a total of two washes. Pellets were dried by placing tubes open in a Class 2AII biosafety cabinet for 5 minutes to allow the trace acetone to evaporate, then pellets were resuspended in 200 µL of Urea/Tris buffer (6 M Urea dissolved in 0.4 M Tris base, pH 7.8) and stored at -20°C. Protein concentrations were measured using the Biorad Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). For SDS-PAGE, 5.7 µg total protein from each sample in a 30 µL volume of Urea/Tris buffer described above was mixed with 10 µL of 4x Laemelli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Each sample was then heated for 10 minutes in a 95°C heat block before loading the entire 40 µL volume into each well on a 10% acrylamide gel and running at 150V for 35 minutes. Entire lanes of SDS-PAGE gel were excised with a scalpel and diced into 1 mm2 cubes. In-gel trypsin digestion was then performed.	Protein identification and quantification were performed using a label-free quantitative shotgun mass proteomics approach using an HPLC-Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (UF-ICBR proteomics core). Briefly, the peptide samples were analyzed using a 250 mm Ultrahigh-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The Thermo EASY nano-LC system was used for liquid chromatography, employing a 20 mm C16 pre-column (Thermo Scientific) to remove impurities. A reversed-phase C18 analytical column with a 100Å pore (Thermo Scientific, Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 LC Column) was used for sample separation. The following solvents were used for chromatography: solvent A (0.1% formic acid), solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) with a 2-40% solvent B acetonitrile gradient for 105 minutes, followed by a 14-minute wash with 98% solvent B, and equilibration with 2% solvent A. The LC system was directly interfaced with the Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. The Orbitrap detector acquired MS data at 120K resolution with a scan range of 350-2000 m/z. For MS/MS analysis, ions were isolated by a quadrupole, prioritizing the most intense ions, and ions for all available parallelizable times were injected. Precursor ions were then excluded for 36 seconds. Fragmentation was performed using collision-induced dissociation (CID) at a collision energy of 35% and an activation time of 10 ms.	RCCS growth experiments were performed using 50 ml disposable HARVs. All HARVs were rotated at 20 RPM at room temperature (~23°C), either on a horizontal base (normal gravity and inverted normal gravity controls; axis of rotation parallel to the gravitational vector) or on a vertical base (LSMMG; axis of rotation perpendicular to the gravitational vector). Inverted HARVs were rotated on a horizontal base inverted 180° (inverted normal gravity control; axis of rotation parallel to the gravitational vector). For RCCS growth, approximately 300 µL of TSYG overnight culture was added to 180 mL of TSYG medium and mixed well prior to filling of 3 x 50 ml HARVs (1 each of normal gravity control, inverted control, and LSMMG per experiment, 4 experiments total). At 36 hours growth, each HARV was removed from its rotator base, shaken vigorously to ensure mixing of cells and disruption of any cell clumps, and 40 mL of culture was removed and split into four 10 mL aliquots in Falcon tubes.	Samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4,500 rpm and 4°C, and supernatants were then each filtered through a 0.22 µm filter into new sterile Falcon tubes. Cell-free supernatants were stored at -80°C until processing for secretomics.
