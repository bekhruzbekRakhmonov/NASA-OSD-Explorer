Study Title	Single-molecule long-read methylation profiling reveals regional DNA methylation regulated by Elongator Complex Subunit 2 in Arabidopsis roots experiencing spaceflight
Study Description	The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 - Epigenetic Expression (APEX-04-EpEx) experiment onboard the International Space Station examined the spaceflight-altered cytosine methylation in two genetic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana, wild-type Col-0 and the mutant elp2-5, which is deficient in an epigenetic regulator Elongator Complex Subunit 2 (ELP2). Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) revealed distinct spaceflight associated methylation differences, presenting the need to explore specific space-altered methylation at single-molecule resolution to associate specific changes over large regions of spaceflight related genes. To date, tools of multiplexed targeted DNA methylation sequencing remain limited for plant genomes. This data set includes single-molecule profiling in user-defined targets using Flap-Enabled Next-Generation Capture (FENGC) on Arabidopsis root tissues to reveal precise modification of DNA methylation regulated by Elongator Complex Subunit 2 during spaceflight.

Study Protocol Description	The Advanced Plant Experiment 04– Epigenetic Expression (APEX-04-EpEx) spaceflight experiment was launched onto International Space Station (ISS) through the SpaceX mission CRS-10. In brief, seeds were sterilized and sown on growth medium containing 0.5% phytagel, 0.5× Murashige–Skoog salts, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose, and 1 × Gamborg’s Vitamin Mixture, in Petri dishes (100 mm × 15 mm; Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, USA), which were then sealed with breathable tape (3 M Micropore, Maplewood, USA). Plants were grown in the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) facility on the ISS and the Veggie hardware in the ISS environmental simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center under constant LED light of 100–135 µmol/m2s Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) until 11 days after germination. Plates were held in place within Veggie using the APEX Petri Plate Holder. Veggie was outfitted with a holder that allowed for the lighting from the Veggie unit to illuminate the science within.	Harvest was conducted on-orbit using RNALater (Ambion, Grand Island, USA) in Kennedy Space Center fixation tubes (KFTs). Plants from each plate were collected into individual KFTs and stored at -80 °C until delivery to the lab for analysis.	DNA extraction was conducted using the protocol designed for RNAlater preserved plant samples. Root and shoot samples were blotted with kimwipes, weighed, and rinsed twice in 3 mL of wash buffer (50 mM EDTA, 25 mM EGTA) for 10 minutes. Samples were blotted again on kimwipes and transferred to mortar and pestle and ground in liquid nitrogen. 900 µL of lysis buffer (10 mM EDTA, 50 mM EGTA, 50 mM Tris), 80 µL of proteinase K (80 mg/mL), and 100 µL of 10% SDS were added and further ground. Samples were incubated at 65°C overnight. 300 µL of 5M potassium acetate was added to each sample and put on ice for 30 minutes. Each sample was then spun in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 5 minutes, supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and spun for an additional 5 minutes. The supernatant was then split between two 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and 800 µL isopropanol was added and the tubes were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Tubes were then spun at maximum speed for 10 minutes, the liquid was poured off, and the resulting pellet was air-dried for 15 minutes at room temperature. Pellets were suspended in 50 µL of TER buffer (10 mM TrisHCl, 1 mM EDTA, 100 µg/µL RNase), split tubes were combined into one tube per sample and incubated at 60°C for 20 minutes. 100 µL of 25:24:1 phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol was added to each tube, mixed, and spun at max speed for 10 minutes. The aqueous (upper) phase was transferred to a new tube and 40 µL of 7.5 M ammonium acetate (AmOAc) and 300 µL of 95% ethyl alcohol (EtOH) were added, the tubes were inverted to mix, and placed at -20°C overnight. Tubes were then spun at 4°C for 10 minutes, the EtOH and AmOAc solution was poured off, and the pellets were rinsed with 70% EtOH three times, dried for 15 minutes and suspended in 100 µL 0.25x TE buffer.	The library construction of FENGC products on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Sequel IIe SMRT platform was performed by Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) at the University of Florida. Products of flap-enabled next-generation capture (FENGC) were subjected to EM-seq conversion and PCR using universal primers. Instrument: Sequel II, Strategy: Targeted-Capture, Source: OTHER, Selection: other, Layout: SINGLE. Approximately 200 ng of Arabidopsis genomic DNA was fragmented by sonication using a Bioruptor Pico (Diagenode, Denville, USA) for 6 cycles of 5 sec on and 30 sec off in 20 µl ddH~2~O. The concentration of oligo-1, -2, and − 3 was 18 nM each in the master tube as recommended. Flap cleavage was performed in the presence of FENGC universal oligo 1-T (U1-T oligo), flap oligos-1 and − 2 specific for 108 targets, and thermostable FEN1 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, USA). Ligation was initiated by adding a stock mixture of oligos-3 for all 108 targets, U2 oligo, and Ampligase (Lucigen, Middleton, USA) to the same tube. DNA not ligated to U2 oligo and therefore not protected by 3’ C3 Spacer was removed by addition of exonucleases I and III (NEB, Ipswich, USA). The enriched products were purified and then subjected to enzymatic methylation conversion according to the manual of NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq Conversion Module (NEB, Ipswich, USA). Converted DNA was amplified for 23 cycles using U1 and U2 primers and KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil + DNA polymerase (Roche, Pleasanton, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. FENGC amplification products were purified and product quality and quantity were determined using Agilent TapeStation D1000 system (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) and Qubit 3 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, USA), respectively.	The sequencing of FENGC products on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) Sequel IIe SMRT platform was performed by Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) at the University of Florida. The HiFi reads were generated using 30-h movie of circular consensus (CCS) mode with filtering for ≥ 3 passes per single polymerase read, with default settings for other parameters.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.
