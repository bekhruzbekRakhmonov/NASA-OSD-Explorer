Study Title	Effects of 32 Days Aboard the ISS on Quadricep Tendon Nanomechanics (Quadricep femoris tendon, RR-1 and Atomic Force Microscopy)
Study Description	Collagen is an essential component of connective tissue and plays a crucial role in elasticity, stability, and force distribution. While the adaptations of tendon to internal stimuli have been extensively researched, the impact of environmental factors (such as microgravity) on its structure and function at the nanoscopic scale (i.e., fibril level) remains largely unexplored. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of 32 days (d) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on murine tendon collagen fibril morphology and nanomechanics (Young’s Modulus, YM). Quadriceps tendon samples from 16wk old female C57BL/6J mice aboard NASA Rodent Research-1 underwent chemical processing and mechanical isolation. Subsequently, collagen fibrils (n equals 38) were studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM, JPK NanoWizard 4a) to compare the morphology (diameter, height) and nanomechanics (average YM) between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) mouse tendon samples. The qp-BioAC-CB1 cantilever (spring constant: 0.3 N/m, tip radius: 10µm) was used under quantitative imaging mode (Qi) for all force and morphological measurements. The data from 17 micrographs (SF n equals 23; GC n equals 15) was processed via the JPK Data Processing Software (Version 6.4.5.), and finally analyzed via Gwyddion (Version 2.62). To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to use AFM QI-mode on tendon collagen fibrils after spaceflight. Mean fibril size and YM were similar between SF and GC mouse tendon fibrils after 32 days of space flight; these results suggest that collagen fibrils may require more time to adapt to changes in their environment, and/or more rapid changes may take place at different levels of the collagen hierarchy. This data provides valuable insights into mammalian tissue adaptations during spaceflight, and future research should continue these investigations with longer-duration missions to build a time-course of tendon adaptations to microgravity. All results derived are from atomic force microscopy using quadriceps femoris tendon tissue.

Study Protocol Description	A cohort of sixteen-week-old female C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratory) were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 37-38 days. Mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls (GC) housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Mice were fed Standard Chow (LabDiet5K52), then Nutrient Upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB). Deionized water was provided ad libitum from sipper tubes, then lixit spouts. The mice were given a 12:12 hour light/dark cycle (lights on: 0600–1800 GMT). Daily video health checks were given for the mice. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).	The mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes. Multiple tissues were collected from each carcass. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue. After harvesting, Quadriceps femoris muscle was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, then transferred into a -80 C freezer.	Each trial was taken with a new cantilever to ensure tip health between trials. All pre-mechanical checks were completed before testing, including consistent summation of the laser and consistent calibration before each micrograph was taken. The AFM was left to warm for approximately 1-2 hours prior to testing. Under no circumstance was any equipment changed in between trials. This included frosted cantilever mounts, cantilever mounting screws, optical microscopes, and AFM heads.	All images were taken in quantitative imaging mode. The parameters were unchanged throughout the experiments to reduce the possibility of bias or differing values for data analysis. Humidity was 30% (+/-5%) for all trials and room temperature was 23-26°C.	"12-24 hours prior to testing, samples were removed from the -80°C freezer and thawed in PBS (Fischer Scientific Catalog: BP399500) at 4°C. Once the tissue was thawed, a series of hand washes were done to minimize the amount of debris potentially adhered to the sample. Samples were then treated in a Trypsin treatment (.05g/15mL extraction medium) to promote fluffing of the collagen. The extraction medium consisted of a pH 7.5-8.0 0.1M Tris-HCl stock solution, in addition to EDTA and deionized (DI) water. pH tuning was not needed for this study; however, the protocol stated the use of NaOH (if needed). Washed/treated sample were placed into a deep plastic well and longitudinal cuts were made using a razor blade (Fischer Scientific Catalog: 22-444-264) superficially to disrupt the endotenon. The consequent outlets made from the cuts allowed the chemical treatment to act on the collagen while degrading the outer fascia not needed for mechanical testing. With the tissue fully enlarged from the chemical treatments, the tissues were pulled apart into a thin sheet across the plastic well. Pulling apart of the sheet longitudinally into two identically sized/smaller sheets left a barren space in between for fibril pooling.

All samples were kept hydrated under deionized water during mechanical testing. Any samples that dried due to the optical microscopes stage light during fibril visualization were not included in this work. Focused scans for each trial were done without the stage light on to minimize dehydration due to external heat on the samples."	"All micrographs were taken with 512x512px resolution. Survey scans in were taken through a 10x10 um region, followed by a 1x1um scan region for focused scans. Suspected fibrils were centered around the middle of the scan region and rotated to ensure non-diagonal scans for the cantilever. This was done to prevent smearing and scarring.

Micrographs were processed via the JPK data processing software in order to export data-fit and data-image files that were later used for morphological and force data analysis. For analysis, Gwyddion is used to collect mean, max and targeted data from processed micrographs. Leveling of the glass slide and the removal of debris was done on all processed micrographs to ensure that non-collagen material was left out of the file data export. The data was then exported to Excel and SPSS for statistical analysis between spaceflight and ground control groups.

Within the raw and processed data files, the sample file names are written in the format ‘RR1_qi_M30QUL2_SF4BIOAC_1’, where: RR1 equals Rodent Research 1, qi equals Quantitative Imaging Mode, M29 equals NASA Animal Source Name/Vial Name, QU equals Quadricep/Left1 or Left2, GF/SF equals Ground Control or Spaceflight, 1-6 equals Trial Number, BIOAC equals cantilever tip, and the final number represents the image/replicate number. Within the Processed Data Files folder, files ending with an m.gwy or f.gwy indicate a morphology (m) or force (f) curve file. Please refer to the accompanying ReadME document  for further details about the file types."	To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining. Specifically, from four originally supplied excel files, data from the first tabs were combined and aligned in a .csv file. All mouse sample names and accompanying stats were realigned in the process; duplicate rows and formatting was removed in the final .csv file.
