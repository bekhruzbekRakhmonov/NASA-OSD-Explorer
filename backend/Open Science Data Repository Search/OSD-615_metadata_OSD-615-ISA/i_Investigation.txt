Study Identifier	OSD-615
Study Title	Glycome profiling and immunohistochemistry uncover changes in cell walls of Arabidopsis thaliana roots during spaceflight: Advanced Plant EXperiment (APEX) 03-1 Raw Dataset
Study Description	This study was conducted to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms by which microgravity impacts cell wall architecture in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) housed on the International Space Station (ISS). Based on our previous space flight studies using the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware on the STS-131 Space Shuttle mission, we found that plants respond to microgravity in large part through the transcriptional reprogramming of genes that control cell wall remodeling. This follow-up spaceflight experiment called the Advanced Plant EXperiments (APEX 03-1) in Space was designed to use Veggie unit on the ISS and on the ground unit on the Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) to probe deeper into spaceflight-induced cell wall associated transcript expression changes. In this study we used RNA-Seq in combination with glycome profiling (glycomics) to correlate spaceflight-induced gene expression changes with actual cell wall modifications within seedlings.

Study Protocol Description	"Sterilized seeds of wild-type (ecotype Columbia-0) were planted on growth media (1.2% phyta-agar) consisting of 0.5X Murashige-Skoog (MS) salts and 1% (w/v) sucrose (pH of 5.7) layered onto 90 X 90 mm square Petri dishes (Simport Scientific Inc., Beloeil, Quebec, Canada).

Immediately after planting, Petri dishes containing the seeds were exposed to far-red (FR) light (3.2 micromole per square meter per second) for 10 minutes using a specially constructed rectangular metal box as described in Nakashima et al. (2014). Such FR treatment promotes dormancy in A. thaliana seeds, preventing premature germination prior to arrival in orbit. A single light emitting diode (LED) (ER-R2, 4606, Norlux Corporation, Carol Stream, Illinois, USA) was used to provide FR illumination to the seeds inside the Petri dishes. FR treatment was carried out under dim light with the distance between the FR LED and Petri dish set at 70 mm. Petri dishes were immediately wrapped with a layer of aluminum foil after FR treatment to keep seeds in complete darkness during imbibition. Petri dishes were then stored in a 4C refrigerator prior to launch. The Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Dragon Spacecraft on the SpaceX Commercial Resupply Service (CRS)-5 mission was launched from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 4:47 A.M. (EST) on January 10, 2015.

To activate the experiment and trigger germination while in orbit, the aluminum foil was removed, and the Petri dishes were installed in the Veggie plant growth hardware. One Veggie unit was located at the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) located at the SSPF and used as the ground controls. The other unit was located in the Columbus module on the ISS and used as the spaceflight set. LEDs on Veggie were programmed to provide constant white light at an intensity of 120-140 micromole per square meter per second. Temperature in the Veggie was maintained at 24C. After the Petri plates were installed in Veggie, seedlings were harvested at 6 and 11 days."	Seedlings were harvested at 6 and 11 days after experiment activation and transferred to Kennedy Fixation Tubes (KFTs), containing either RNAlater (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) or 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (both from Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2). Harvesting and fixation on KFTs was performed by Expedition 42 commander Barry Wilmore who completed the process in 2 hours. KFTs containing the chemicals were kept in the dark and at 4C until fixation. Details on KFT actuation are described in Nakashima et al. (2014). Actuated KFTs with RNAlater were stored in a -80C laboratory freezer (ground controls), or in the Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI), whereas those with aldehydes were kept at 4C. Samples returned to Earth at 4:44 P.M. (PST) on February 11, 2015. Fixed seedlings were retrieved from the KFTs at KSC four days after the Dragon Spacecraft splash down and were turned over to the investigator team three days later. Individual seedlings fixed by paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde mixture were then carefully separated into shoots and roots, and photographed prior to processing for microscopy. Seedlings from spaceflight and corresponding ground controls fixed in RNAlater were thawed, dried using Kimwipes, ground in liquid nitrogen, and stored in -80F prior to RNA isolation.	Seedlings from spaceflight and corresponding ground controls fixed in RNAlater were thawed, dried using Kimwipes, ground in liquid nitrogen, and stored in -80F prior to RNA isolation. Seedlings were divided into shoots and roots, and total RNA was isolated using Plant RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The pellet of cell-debris in the QIAGEN shredder spin columns were saved and processed for glycomics. Glycome profiling of cell wall extracts was conducted using a single step extraction. Briefly, alcohol insoluble materials from root debris were first isolated and extracted with a 4 M KOH solution containing 1% (w/v) sodium borohydride. The extract was dialyzed exhaustively against water and lyophilized before subjecting to glycome profiling. The 4 M KOH extract was then screened by ELISA using a comprehensive suite of plant cell wall glycan-directed mAbs that recognized most of the major non-cellulosic glycan epitopes in plant cell walls. ELISAs were performed by coating 0.3 μg glucose equivalents of carbohydrate materials onto the each well of a 384-well dish (Costar 3700, Corning Inc, Corning, NY, USA). ELISAs were conducted with a fully automated robotic system (Automated ELISA Workstation, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Waltham, MA, USA). The ELISA response values are depicted as heat maps to reflect the relative abundance of glycan epitopes recognized by the mAbs.
