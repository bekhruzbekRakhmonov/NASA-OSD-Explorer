Study Title	Whole Blood Measurements from the SpaceX Inspiration4 Mission (RNA-seq, epitranscriptome, WGS, clonal hematopoiesis, CBC)
Study Description	The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission was a 3-day mission with four private astronauts to low Earth orbit that occurred in September 2021. The crew collected biospecimen samples before, during, and after flight. One of these biospecimen collections included whole blood collected via venipuncture into PaxGene Blood RNA tubes (BD Biosciences, #762165), collected pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) and post-flight (R+1, R+45, R+82, R+194). Total RNA was purified from each tube and mRNA was sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies direct RNA-sequencing kit on the PromethION. Data was used to generate differential gene expression profiles and annotate sites of m6A modification. Additionally, whole genome sequencing was performed on crew members at L-44 and R+45 and a clonal hematopoiesis panel was performed on a subset of 9 genes (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, TP53, CHEK2, JAK2, SRSF2, SF3B1, PPM1D). For these, DNA was isolated from the pellet of a cfDNA blood collection tube (Streck, cat #230470) (L-44, L-3, R+1, R+45, R+82, R+194). Finally, whole blood collected in K2 EDTA tubes (BD Biosciences, cat# 367844) were submitted to Quest Diagnostics for a complete blood count at all ground timepoints (L-92, L-44, L-3, R+1, R+45, R+82, R+194).

Study Protocol Description	All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. We analyzed samples before and after a 3-day mission to space.	For long-read RNAseq and bulkRNAseq, 2.5 mL of whole blood was collected in PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (BD Biosciences, cat no. 762165). Tube was gently inverted 8-10 times. Tube was stored upright for a minimum of 2 hours, then was placed at -20°C until nucleic acid extraction. For whole genome sequencing and panel clonal hematopoiesis assay, 10mL of whole blood was collected into a Streck cfDNA blood collection tube (cat  230470). Tube centrifuged for 20min at 300g. The red blood cell (RBC) pellet was frozen at -80C. For Complete Blood Count (CBC), one 4mL tube of whole blood was collected in a K2 EDTA tube (BD Biosciences, cat  367844) and submitted to Quest Diagnostics ( test code 6399) for processing.	Total RNA was extracted using the PAXgene Blood RNA kit (Qiagen, cat no. Qiagen 762164) according to the manufacturer's protocol.	Poly-A mRNA was isolated from approximately 50-500 ng of total RNA using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs). The resulting mRNA was converted into cDNA using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs). After end repair/dA-tailing, adaptor ligation, and USER-enzyme digestion, indexing PCR was carried out using the UG Library Amplification Kit (Ultima Genomics) with custom indexing primers that amplify the TruSeq Read1 and Read 2 sequences, but are appended with Ultima Genomics adapter sequences. After 11 cycles of PCR, amplification products were cleaned up using a 1.0x ratio of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Overhang generation was carried out using components from the UG Library Amplification Kit (Ultima Genomics) and material was size selected using a dsSPRI approach with 0.6x/0.85x AMPure XP beads. Quality control of the resulting libraries was carried out using the DNA High Sensitivity Bioanalyzer Reagents (Agilent Technologies) and concentrations were measured via Qubit HS DNA Quantification Kit (ThermoFisher).	Sample pools were then seeded onto UG sequencing beads, pre-enriched, and amplified by emulsion PCR, leveraging UG’s automated sequencing bead preparation system (AMP). Sequencing was performed on UG100 sequencing systems, running 464 flow-cycles (116 cycles across each of the four nucleotides [T, G, C, A]).	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.	Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ direct RNA library prep protocol (SQK-RNA002) for PromethION was used. Input amount for each sample library preparation was 500 ng of total RNA.	Each library was divided in two, and brought up to loading volume by adding ONT’s EB (Elution Buffer). One PromethION flow cell (FLO-PRO002) was used per library (i.e per sample), and libraries were sequenced on PromethION 48 beta for 72 hours using the MinKNOW software. Runs were paused and the remaining half of each library was reloaded ~18 hours into the sequencing run onto their respective flow cells. Following this, runs were continued for the remainder of 72 hours.	Fast5 files were basecalled with Guppy version 6.2.1 [community.nanoporetech.com], and alignment of raw nanopore events to the basecalled sequences was done with the f5c module eventalign5. Quality assessment was performed with pycoQC and MultiQC. The Oxford Nanopore Technologies pipeline, pipeline-transcriptome-de, was used to quantify transcripts and to subsequently perform the differential expression analysis. pipeline-transcriptome-de performs the quantification with salmon, accounting for multi-mapping reads; therefore, we included the highest-scoring secondary minimap2 alignments (minimap2 switch -p1.0) in the input for the pipeline. Differential gene expression results, which pipeline-transcriptome-de generates with edgeR while collapsing transcripts into respective genes. Differentially expressed genes were also calculated using minimap2, featureCounts, DESeq2, and the SARTools wrapper package. m6Anet was used to detect m6A modifications. As required by m6anet, the transcriptomic alignments were filtered to retain primary mappings only (minimap2 switch --secondary equals no). Sites of m6A modifications were annotated with probabilities of methylation via m6anet, and methylKit was then used to discover differentially methylated sites between conditions; sites were deemed significant if the resultant methylKit q-value fell below 0.01, as recommended by the tool's authors.	One 4mL tube of whole blood collected in a K2EDTA tube (BD Biosciences, Cat. 367844) was submitted to Quest Diagnostics, test code 6399. The Sysmex XN analyzer performs hematology analysis according to the hydrodynamic focusing (DC Detection), flow cytometry method (semiconductor laser), and SLS hemoglobin method.	To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.	Red blood cell (RBC) pellet was thawed at RT and DNA was extracted with the QIAamp Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen  51192).	The extracted DNA was shipped to Element Biosciences (San Diego, CA) for library preparation. The extracted DNA was quantified using Thermo Fisher Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (cat  Q238253). KAPA HyperPrep Kit (Roche, cat  07962363001) was used for preparing all extracted DNA samples per manufacturer’s instructions. Adapters used were KAPA Unique-Dual Indexed Adapter Kit (Roche, cat  08861919702). 8 DNA samples were library prepared, Covaris sheared and PCR-free. The DNA libraries were quantified using Thermo Fisher Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (cat  Q238253) and sized using Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (cat  5067-4626).	The 8 DNA libraries generated with the KAPA HyperPrep Kit were processed using Adept Library Compatibility Kit (Element Biosciences, cat  830-00003). Each library was circularized individually with an input of 0.5pmol (30 ul of 16.67nM). The final circularized libraries were quantified using qPCR standard and primer mix provided in the Adept Compatibility Workflow Kit (cat  830-00007). The 8 circular libraries were pooled into 4 separate 2-plex pools. Each 2-plex pool was denatured and sequenced on Element AVITI system (Element Biosciences, Part  88-00001) using 2x150 paired end reads with indexing.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.	Illumina sequencing adapters containing unique molecular identifiers were ligated onto short-read fragments according to the Kapa Bio-systems HyperPrep protocol (Roche, cat  07962363001). Targeted enrichment of 9 genes (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, TP53, CHEK2, JAK2, SRSF2, SF3B1, PPM1D) involved in clonal hematopoiesis was performed following the standard Invitae capture protocol.	Deep sequencing was performed to a depth of ~ 15,000x using Novaseq 6000 and 150x150 S4 chemistry.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.
