Study Title	Spatial characterization of microbial communities on multi-species leafy greens grown simultaneously in the Veggie vegetable production systems on the International Space Station VEG-03D
Study Description	Investigates the microbial communities of plants and Veggie pillow components with culturable and non-culturable methods providing qualitative and quantitative data. This studies also stresses the food safety component of fresh crops grown on the ISS. The VEG-03D technology demonstration was completed achieving simultaneous multi-species plant growth within a Veggie unit on the International Space Station (ISS). Microbiological characterization using molecular and culture-based methods was performed on leaves and roots from two harvests of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, (Brassica rapa var japonica); and green leaf lettuce, (Lactuca sativa cv. Waldmann’s) and associated rooting pillow components and Veggie chamber surfaces. Culture based enumeration and pathogen screening indicated the leafy greens were safe for consumption. Surface samples of the Veggie facility and plant pillows revealed low counts of bacteria and fungi and are commonly isolated on ISS. Community analysis was completed with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Comparisons between pillow components, and plant tissue types from VEG-03D, E, and F revealed higher diversity in roots and rooting substrate than the leaves and wick. This work provides valuable information for food production-related research on the ISS and the impact of the plant microbiome on this unique closed environment.

Study Protocol Description	All Veggie pillows were assembled at Kennedy Space Center, FL and prepared for flight as described in detail by Massa et al., 2017. Crop seeds were sanitized using a bleach/ hydrochloric acid (HCl) fuming method. Approximately 75–100 seeds were batch sanitized by adding 0.5 ml concentrated HCl to 30 ml bleach (5% sodium hypochlorite solution) in a 500 ml wide-mouth jar and placing an open petri dish containing the seeds into the bleach container, without submersion, then sealing the container to maintain the chlorine fumes around the seeds. Seeds were sanitized for 1 h before being removed from the acid/bleach container for off-gassing overnight (approximately 24 h) in a laminar flow hood. Two seeds were planted in Veggie pillows in calcined clay (arcillite)  and 7.5 g/ liter− 1 of 18–6-8, type 100-day time-release fertilizer (Nutricote Florikan ESA, Sarasota, FL, United States). Seeds were germinated and grown in controlled-environment growth chambers simulating environmental conditions aboard the ISS (50% relative humidity, 3000-ppm CO2, temperature 23 C). The photoperiod was set at 16 h/8 h light dark cycles with LED lights providing 200–300 μmol m− 2 s− 1 photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). During VEG-03D operation, a fan anomaly occurred, causing a rise in humidity to 100% for approximately 25 days inside the Veggie facility and condensation on the bellows surface.	Pillows were thinned to a single plant per pillow . Four harvests were completed.  Samples from harvest 2 and 4 were frozen and returned for analysis. Plant tissues were separated into leaf and root and placed in pre-weighed 50-ml tubes containing sterile water and glass beads and analyzed for microbial load using culture based and molecular methods. Surface swab samples were collected by the crew from 8 different sites within or on the Veggie facility using self-contained sterile swabs (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), three from the interior bellows, one from the upper one-third of the bellows, one in the middle, and the third from the lower portion, three plant pillow top surfaces, one from the internal fan screen, and one from the fan outlet vent ports. After sample collection, the swabs were returned to the sterile container and stored frozen at -80 C in the Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer on ISS (MELFI).	DNA was isolated from each sample using the Qiagen Cell Kit and was followed by PCR  for the 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and barcoded primers for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) for fungi.	Samples were diluted to 4 nM and an equimolar concentration library was created per Illumina’s library preparation guidelines. The library was spiked with a 10% PhiX aliquot to add diversity to the library.	Sequencing was completed using the Illumina MicroSeq V2500 cycle  kits. Sequencing was completed as paired end on the Illumina MiSeq Next Generation Sequencer (NGS). FastQ sequences were identified to the genus level using the RDP/GreenGenes and SILVA (bacteria) and Unite (fungal) databases.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.
