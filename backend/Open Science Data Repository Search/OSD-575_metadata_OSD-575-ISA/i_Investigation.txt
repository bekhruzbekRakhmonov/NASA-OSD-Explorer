Study Identifier	OSD-575
Study Title	SpaceX Inspiration4 Blood Serum Metabolic Panel and Immune/Cardiac Cytokine Arrays (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and Multiplex)
Study Description	The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission was a 3-day mission with four private astronauts to low Earth orbit that occurred in September 2021. The crew collected biospecimen samples before, during, and after flight. One of these biospecimen collections included whole blood collected via venipuncture, with serum extracted from blood using a serum separator tube (SST). Samples were collected pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) and post-flight (R+1, R+45, R+82). Serum samples were submitted for immune and cardiovascular cytokine biomarker profiling panels at two different companies (Eve Technologies and Alamar), and to Quest Diagnostics for comprehensive metabolic panel testing. Data was used to measure changes in cytokines and metabolic measures during spaceflight. This study derives results from the Comprehensive Metabolic Panel and Multiplex assays, and the blood serum data in this study are related to other studies using data from the same experiment; OSD-569 (whole blood), OSD-570 (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), OSD-571 (plasma), OSD-572 (skin, oral, and nasal swabs),  OSD-573 (Dragon capsule samples), OSD-574 (skin biopsy), OSD-656 (urine), and OSD-630 (stool).

Study Protocol Description	To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.	Frozen serum aliquots were shipped to Alamar Biosciences (Fremont, CA).	The NULISA-seq Inflammation Panel was performed, which targets 124 cytokines/chemokines and 80 other proteins related to immune response. NGS data were processed using the NULISAseq algorithm (Alamar Biosciences). The sample- (SMI) and target-specific (TMI) barcodes were quantified, and up to two mismatching bases or one indel and one mismatch were allowed. Intraplate normalization was performed by dividing the target counts for each sample well by that well’s internal control (mCherry) counts. Interplate normalization was performed using interplate control (IPC) normalization, in which counts were divided by target-specific medians of the three IPC wells on that plate, and then rescaled by the factor 10^4. To facilitate statistical analyses, IPC-normalized counts were log2-transformed to form a more normal distribution. These log2 IPC-normalized counts are referred to as NULISA Protein Quantification (NPQ) units. Methods for data processing and normalization were extracted from Feng et al 2023 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.09.536130v2.full.pdf).	Frozen serum samples were submitted to Eve Technologies (Calgary, Canada) for biomarker profiling.	The biomarker profiling panel Human Cytokine/Chemokine 71-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HD71) was used. Concentration values were extrapolated using a 4 of 5 parameter logic standard curve. Measurements were normalized by average of pre-flight values from all crew.	Frozen serum samples were submitted to Eve Technologies (Calgary, Canada) for biomarker profiling.	The biomarker profiling panel Human Cardiovascular Disease Panel 3 9-Plex Discovery Assay® Array (HDCVD9) was used. Concentration values were extrapolated using a 4 of 5 parameter logic standard curve. Measurements were normalized by average of pre-flight values from all crew.	All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. We analyzed samples before and after a 3-day mission to space.	Serum separator tubes (SSTs, BD Biosciences:  367987) were spun at 1300xg for 10 minutes. Fresh serum was sent at room temperature to Quest Diagnostics for a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). The remaining serum was frozen at -80C.	Fresh serum was submitted to Quest Diagnostics (test code 10231) and run on a Beckman Coulter AU5800.
