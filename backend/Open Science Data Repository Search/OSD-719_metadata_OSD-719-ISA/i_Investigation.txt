Study Title	Sexual Dimorphism during Integrative Endocrine and Immune Responses to Ionizing Radiation in Mice -- Blood data
Study Description	Exposure to cosmic ionizing radiation is an innate risk of the spaceflight environment that can cause DNA damage and altered cellular function. In astronauts, longitudinal monitoring of physiological systems and interactions between these systems are important to consider for mitigation strategies. In addition, assessments of sex-specific biological responses in the unique environment of spaceflight are vital to support future exploration missions that include both females and males. Here we assessed sex-specific, multi-system immune and endocrine responses to simulated cosmic radiation. For this, 24-week-old, male and female C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to simplified five-ion, space-relevant galactic cosmic ray (GCRsim) radiation at 15 and 50 cGy, to simulate predicted radiation exposures that would be experienced during lunar and Martian missions, respectively. Blood and adrenal tissues were collected at 3- and 14-days post-exposure for analysis of immune and endocrine biosignatures and pathways. Sexually dimorphic adrenal gland weights and morphology, differential total RNA expression, and unique immune phenotypes were altered by GCRsim. In brief, this study offers new insights into sexually dimorphic immune and endocrine kinetics following simulated cosmic radiation exposure and highlights the necessity for personalized translational approaches for astronauts during exploration missions. This study includes data from blood samples only.

Study Protocol Description	All animal experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) protocol number 516. All experiments were performed by trained personnel in AAALAC accredited animal facilities at BNL, while conforming to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. This study is reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. 24-week-old C57Bl/6J male and female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (CA, USA) and shipped to Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) 14-days prior to irradiation (IR-14). At arrival to BNL, mice were quarantined and acclimated to a 12h light : 12h dark cycle at standard temperature (23±2°C) and humidity (approximately 50%). Food and water were given ad libitum, and bedding was changed weekly. At IR-4, mice were socially isolated, and, at IR+0, mice irradiated with the 5-ion galactic cosmic ray radiation (GCRsim) at 0, 15, and 50 cGy doses. On day IR-1, mice were transferred to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) on BNL’s campus by animal care staff. On day IR+0, mice received whole-body irradiation using the simplified 5-ion GCRsim irradiation scheme (protons at 250 and 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/n, 4He at 250 MeV/n, 16O at 350 MeV/n, and 56Fe at 600 MeV/n) with 15 and 50 cGy, while 0 cGy sham controls were also performed in similar housing condition, in the absence of irradiation. GCRsim ions, energies, and doses were determined by a NASA consensus formula as previously described. Beam time exposures ranged from ~15 minutes (15 cGy) to 35-45 minutes (50 cGy) per n equals 12 batched cohorts. NSRL GCR and SPE simulations are designed to approximate the chronic mixed field exposures in space by means of sequential acute exposures to a variety of ion/energy combinations.  The exposure protocols are on the NSRL website: https://www.bnl.gov/nsrl/userguide/simgcrsim.php (SimGCRSim).  The dose can be administered either in a single series of exposures lasting approximately an hour or in daily fractions over several weeks.  The GCR simulations are described in detail here: Simonsen LC, Slaba TC, Guida P, Rusek A (2020) NASA’s first ground-based Galactic Cosmic Ray Simulator: Enabling a new era in space radiobiology research. PLoS Biol 18(5): e3000669. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000669. There are only 0cGy and 50 cGy samples in this dataset.	At IR+14 mice were euthanized by CO2 overdose. Mice were weighed at euthanasia. Blood was collected through the abdominal aorta (11:00–16:00 h).	Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Thermo Fisher) and purified using Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research).	RNA-sequencing libraries were performed using Illumina’s total RNA kit per manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was determined using an Agilent TapeStation with eRIN values  greater than  7. 500 ng of total RNA was used as input. rRNA was depleted, cDNA (first and second strands) were synthesized, and adaptor index ligation and strand selection was performed (Illumina Stranded total RNA Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus). For multiplexing, barcodes with unique indices out of 96, were used per sample (IDT for Illumina). Libraries were amplified by PCR on a Mastercycler Pro (Eppendorf) and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads (Beckman Coulter).	Libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq1000 (Illumina) to generate 30 M, 75-bp paired end reads per sample.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of Mus-musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.
