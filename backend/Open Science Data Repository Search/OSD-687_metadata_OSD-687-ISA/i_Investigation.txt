Study Identifier	OSD-687
Study Title	SpaceX Inspiration4 T-Cell Histone Modification Profiling (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac)
Study Description	The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission was a 3-day mission with four private astronauts to low Earth orbit that occurred in September 2021. T-cells were isolated from whole blood in one crew member at the  R+194 timepoint for histone modification quantification as a proof of concept study, as no histone modifications have been previously studied in astronaut cohorts. The H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac modifications were profiled using Cut and Run.

Study Protocol Description	All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing.	Whole blood was collected from a K2 EDTA tube (BD Biosciences, cat  367844) at the R+194 day time point.	T cells were isolated using the MACSxpress Whole Blood Pan T Cell Isolation Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi Biotec,  130-098-193). Red Blood Cell Lysis Solution was used to remove any remaining red blood cells in the cell suspension (Miltenyi Biotec,  130-094-183). Cells were pelleted via centrifuge at 300×g for 10 minutes at room temperature and resuspended in freezing media (DMSO(10%)/FBS(90%) solution). Cells were frozen until the time of the Cut and Run protocol.	Cut and Run libraries for C002 crew member T cells were prepared following the Epicypher Cutana Cut and Run protocol adapted for a 96 well plate format. Reagents and spin columns were obtained from CUTANA ChIC/CUT and RUN kit (SKU: 14-1048). The experiment was tested with both 10,000 cell inputs and 5,000 cell inputs. Cells were washed and bound with activated ConA beads. After magnetic separation, supernatant was removed and antibody buffer solution was added to each sample along with 1:100 dilutions of antibodies for H3K27ac (Abcam: cat  ab245911 and Active Motif: cat  39034), H3K4me1 (Epicypher: cat  13-0040, Active Motif: cat  39635, and Invitrogen: cat  710795), and H3K3me3 (Cutana: cat  13-0041). Cutana Rabbit IgG antibody (cat : 13-0042) was used as a negative control. Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C rotating followed by magnetic separation and washing with 0.01% digitonin buffer. Cutana pAG-MNase were bound to each sample washed again twice with digitonin buffer and chromatin was digested and released with 100 mM CaCl2 and incubated for 2 hrs at 4°C. Stop buffer with 1ng of Cutana E.coli Spike-in DNA (SKU: 18-1401) was added to each sample followed by an incubation at 37°C for 10 mins. 10ul of purified DNA fragments were used for library prep following the NEBNext Ultra II for DNA protocol but with 16 amplification cycles.	Samples were loaded on a Novaseq S4 flow cell and sequenced paired end 151x151 at 40 million reads.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.
