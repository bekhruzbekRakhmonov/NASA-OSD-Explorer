Study Title	SpaceX Inspiration4 Urine Inflammation Panel (Multiplex, NULISAseq)
Study Description	The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission was a 3-day mission with four private astronauts to low Earth orbit that occurred in September 2021. The crew collected biospecimen samples before, during, and after flight. One of these biospecimen collections included urine from pre-flight and post-flight/recovery timepoints (L-92, L-44, L-3, R+1, R+45, R+82). 203 inflammatory, cytokine, and chemokine proteins were quantified using NULISAseq. This study derives results from the Multiplex assay, and the urine data in this study are related to other studies using data from the same experiment; OSD-569 (whole blood), OSD-570 (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), OSD-571 (plasma), OSD-572 (skin, oral, and nasal swabs),  OSD-573 (Dragon capsule samples), OSD-574 (skin biopsy), OSD-575 (serum), and OSD-630 (stool).

Study Protocol Description	Urine aliquots were thawed and processed immediately.	Urine aliquots were thawed and processed with the NULISAseq 200plex v1 Inflammation Panel (Feng et al.) with two technical replicates (10uL each) per sample. This panel includes 203 targets spanning cytokines, chemokines, and other proteins related to immune response. NGS data were processed using the NULISAseq algorithm (Alamar Biosciences). The sample- (SMI) and target-specific (TMI) barcodes were quantified, and up to two mismatching bases or one indel and one mismatch were allowed. Intraplate normalization was performed by dividing the target counts for each sample well by that wellâ€™s internal control (mCherry) counts. Interplate normalization was performed using interplate control (IPC) normalization, in which counts were divided by target-specific medians of the three IPC wells on that plate, and then rescaled by the factor 10^4. To facilitate statistical analyses, IPC-normalized counts were log2-transformed to form a more normal distribution. These log2 IPC-normalized counts are referred to as NULISA Protein Quantification (NPQ) units. Methods for data processing and normalization were extracted from Feng et al 2023 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.09.536130v2.full.pdf).	To enable maximal data reuse (for machine-readable approaches), the submitted version of this dataset was subsequently transformed and edited to be aligned with a reusable template, which was created through feedback provided by subject matter experts in the ALSDA Analysis Working Group. This transformed reusable version is structured so all results are standardized into specific rows (source/subject) and columns (measures). This enables all assay results to be identically structured for efficient data mining.	All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. We analyzed samples before and after a 3-day mission to space.	Urine was collected from the Inspiration4 crew into sterile collection cups. Samples were aliquoted in a sterile hood and frozen at -80C. Aliquots were shipped to Alamar Bio (Fremont, CA) for biomarker profiling.
