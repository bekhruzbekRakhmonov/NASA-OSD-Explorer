Study Title	SpaceX Inspiration4 Dragon Capsule Metagenomic and Metatranscriptomic Microbial Swabs
Study Description	The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission was a 3-day mission with four private astronauts to low Earth orbit that occurred in September 2021. The crew collected biospecimen samples before, during, and after flight. One of these biospecimen collections included microbial swabs collected from nine surfaces in the Dragon capsule (execute button, G-meter button, control touch screen - left, control touch screen - right, side hatch mobility aid, lid of waste locker, seat 2, commode panel, viewing dome) and one open air control. Swabs were collected twice during flight (flight day 2 (FD2), and flight day 3 (FD3)) and twice pre-flight in the crew training capsule in Hawthorne, CA (L-92, L-44). Swabs were stored in 400uL of Zymo Research DNA/RNA Shield at 4C until nucleic acid extraction. DNA and RNA were extracted from the same swab to generate metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiles.

Study Protocol Description	DNA, RNA and proteins were isolated from each sample using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein Kit (QIAGEN, cat 47054) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, yet omitting steps one and two. In order to lyse biological material from each sample, 350uL of each sample was transferred to a QIAGEN PowerBead Tubes with 0.1mm glass beads and secured to a Vortex-Genie 2 using an adapter (cat 1300-V1-24) before being homogenized for 10 minutes. 350uL of the subsequent lysate was then transferred to a spin-column before proceeding with the protocol. Concentration of the isolated DNA, RNA and protein for each sample were measured by fluorometric quantitation using the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat Q33238) and a corresponding assay kit. The Qubit 1Xds DNA HS Assay Kit for DNA concentration (cat Q33231), the RNA HS Assay Kit (cat Q32855) for RNA concentration.	For library preparation, total RNA samples were sent to Hudson Alpha. Samples were treated with DNAse 1 (Zymo Research, Catalog E1010). Post-DNAse digested samples were then put into the NEBNext rRNA depletion v2 (Human/Mouse/Rat), Ultra II Directional RNA (10 ng), and Unique Dual Index Primer Pairs were used following the vendor protocols from New England Biolabs. Completed libraries were quantified by Qubit or equivalent and run on a Bioanalyzer or equivalent for size determination. Libraries were pooled and quantified by Qubit fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific), TapeStation 2200 (Agilent), and qRT-PCR using the Kapa Biosystems Illumina library quantification kit.	All libraries were pooled and sequenced on a S4 flow cell of the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System with 2 × 150 bp paired-end reads.	Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a human genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were removed.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.	All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. We sequenced analyzed samples from human skin, oral, nasal and environmental swabs before, during, and after a 3-day mission to space.	The crew collected biospecimen samples before, during, and after flight. One of these biospecimen collections included microbial swabs collected from nine surfaces in the Dragon capsule (execute button, G-meter button, control touch screen - left, control touch screen - right, side hatch mobility aid, lid of waste locker, seat 2, commode panel, viewing dome) and one open air control. Swabs were collected twice during flight (flight day 2 (FD2), and flight day 3 (FD3)) and twice pre-flight in the crew training capsule in Hawthorne, CA (L-92, L-44). Isohelix swabs were dipped in nuclease-free water (on-Earth) or Hfactor hydrogen infused water (in-flight). Areas of the SpaceX Dragon Capsule were swabbed for 30 seconds using both sides of the swab. Swabs were then stored in 400uL of Zymo Research DNA/RNA Shield (cat  1100) and kept at room temperature for less than 4 days before being stored at 4C until processing.	Illumina DNA Library prep kit was used for preparing all extracted DNA samples for Illumina Whole genome sequencing per manufacturer’s instructions. Adapters used were IDT® for Illumina® DNA/RNA UD Indexes, Tagmentation (96 Indexes, 96 Samples).	All libraries were pooled and sequenced on a S4 flow cell of the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System with 2 × 150 bp paired-end reads.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.	Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.11. Quality-trimming and filtering was performed with bbmap v38.86. Read-based processing was performed with humann v3.6. Individual samples were assembled with megahit v1.2.9. Genes were called with prodigal v2.6.3. Taxonomic classification of genes and contigs was performed with CAT v5.2.2. Functional annotation was done with KOFamScan v1.3.0. Reads were mapped to assemblies with bowtie2 v2.3.5.1, and coverage information was extracted for reads and contigs with samtools v1.9 and bbmap v38.86. Binning of contigs was performed with metabat2 v2.15. Bins were summarized with bit v1.8.53 and estimates of quality were generated with checkm v1.1.3. High-quality bins (greater than 90% est. completeness and less than 10% est. redundancy) were taxonomically classified with gtdb-tk v1.5.0.
