Study Title	SpaceX Inspiration4 Deltoid Skin and Microbiome Data: Spatial Transcriptomics (NanoString GeoMx), Metageomics, and Metatranscriptomics
Study Description	The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission was a 3-day mission with four private astronauts to low Earth orbit that occurred in September 2021. The crew collected biospecimen samples before, during, and after flight. One of these biospecimen collections included deltoid skin biopsies, collected once pre-flight (L-44) and within 1 day postflight (R+1). Biopsies were 3mm - 4mm in diameter and were frozen at -80C at the time of collection. Samples were then embedded in OCT and prepared for spatially resolved transcriptomics using the NanoString GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas Panel. Skin was profiled in four regions: outer epidermis (OE), inner epidermis (IE), outer dermis (OD), and vasculature (VA) regions. Four crew members were profiled pre-fight (C001, C002, C003, C004) and three crew members were profiled post-flight (C002, C003,  C004). Additionally, skin swabs of the deltoid region were collected before each biopsy. Skin swabs were first dipped in nuclease-free water before swabbing each region for 30 seconds. Swabs were stored in 400uL of Zymo Research DNA/RNA Shield at 4C until nucleic acid extraction. DNA and RNA were extracted from the same swab to generate metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiles.

Study Protocol Description	Collected skin was flash embedded in OCT blocks. Three or 4 replicate OCT-embedded tissues were placed on a single slide per patient including pre and post flight replicates.	Immunofluorescent visualization marker for Pan-Cytokeratin (PanCK, Novus cat  NBP2-33200,  Alexa Fluor® 532, clone ID AE1 + AE3), fibroblast activation protein (FAP, Abcam cat  ab222924, Alexa Fluor® 594, clone ID EPR20021) and smooth muscle actin (SMA, R and D Systems cat  IC1420R, Alexa Fluor® 647, clone 1A4) were used for region or interest (ROI) selection. The DSP whole transcriptome assay (WTA) was used to assess genes collected in each ROI. For DSP processing, OCT slides were thawed overnight in 10% NBF at 4°C followed by PBS washes for thorough fixation.  After washes, slides were prepared following the automated Leica Bond RNA Slide Preparation Protocol for fixed frozen samples, digesting samples with 1.0 µg/mL protease K for 15 min, and antigen retrieval for 20 min at 100°C (NanoString, no. MAN-10115-05). In situ hybridizations with the GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas Panel (WTA, v1.0, 18,677 genes) at 4 nM final concentration were done in Buffer R (NanoString). Morphology markers were prepared for four slides concurrently using Syto13 (DNA), PanCK, FAP and SMA in Buffer W for a total volume of 225 μl per slide. Slides incubated with 225 μl of morphology marker solution at RT for 1 h, then washed in SSC and loaded onto the NanoString DSP instrument. The No Template Control was used to detect contamination in the library prep.	Libraries were constructed with Illumina adapters for paired end sequencing.	Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer.	Images were captured using the NanoString GeoMx system. The 20x scan was used to select freeform ROIs to guide selection of outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions.	FASTQ files were converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline (v2.3.4). From the normalized count matrix, DESeq2 (v1.34.0) was used to perform differential expression analysis.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.	DNA and RNA were extracted with the Qiagen Allprep Bacterial DNA/RNA/Protein Kit (cat  47054).	For library preparation, total RNA samples were sent to Hudson Alpha. Samples were treated with DNAse 1 (Zymo Research, Catalog   E1010). Post-DNAse digested samples were then put into the NEBNext rRNA depletion v2 (Human/Mouse/Rat), Ultra II Directional RNA (10 ng), and Unique Dual Index Primer Pairs were used following the vendor protocols from New England Biolabs. Completed libraries were quantified by Qubit or equivalent and run on a Bioanalyzer or equivalent for size determination. Libraries were pooled and quantified by Qubit fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific), TapeStation 2200 (Agilent), and qRT-PCR using the Kapa Biosystems Illumina library quantification kit.	Libraries were sequenced using 2 x 150 Paired end sequencing on an S4 flow cell using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer.	Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a human genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were removed.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.	Illumina DNA Library prep kit was used for preparing all extracted DNA samples for Illumina Whole genome sequencing per manufacturer’s instructions. Adapters used were IDT® for Illumina® DNA/RNA UD Indexes, Tagmentation (96 Indexes, 96 Samples).	Libraries were sequenced using 2 x 150 Paired end sequencing on an S4 flow cell using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.	Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.11. Quality-trimming and filtering was performed with bbmap v38.86. Read-based processing was performed with humann v3.6. Individual samples were assembled with megahit v1.2.9. Genes were called with prodigal v2.6.3. Taxonomic classification of genes and contigs was performed with CAT v5.2.2. Functional annotation was done with KOFamScan v1.3.0. Reads were mapped to assemblies with bowtie2 v2.3.5.1, and coverage information was extracted for reads and contigs with samtools v1.9 and bbmap v38.86. Binning of contigs was performed with metabat2 v2.15. Bins were summarized with bit v1.8.53 and estimates of quality were generated with checkm v1.1.3. High-quality bins (greater than 90% est. completeness and less than 10% est. redundancy) were taxonomically classified with gtdb-tk v1.5.0.	All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing.	Skin biopsies were performed on the deltoid region of the arm from the L-44 and R+1 timepoint. Each site was prepared by application of ChloraPrep and anesthesia was induced with administration of 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. A trephine punch was used to remove a 3- or 4-mm diameter piece of skin. The resected piece was cut into approximately ⅓ and ⅔ sections. The larger piece was placed in a cryovial and stored at -80°C for spatial transcriptomics. One-third of the sample was stored in formalin and kept at room temperature to perform histology. Skin swabs: Isohelix swabs were dipped in nuclease-free water. Swabs were then stored in 400uL of Zymo Research DNA/RNA Shield (cat 1100).
