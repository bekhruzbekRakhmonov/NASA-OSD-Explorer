Study Title	CI Asteroid Regolith as an In Situ Plant Growth Medium for Space Crop Production
Study Description	Human expansion into the solar system is currently at the forefront of space research. For our astronauts to survive, they will need to be fed a healthy and nutritious diet on a consistent basis. Right now, our current method of feeding astronauts consists of resupplied prepackaged food from Earth, which is unsustainable for long-term missions. Using planetary resources via in situ resource utilization to grow crops is the next step toward sustainability in space. Asteroids are an abundant space resource and should not be overlooked when considering crewed missions. In particular, the primordial CI carbonaceous asteroids are of interest because the regolith is suggested to contain soluble elemental nutrients, such as phosphorous and potassium, that crops can use for growth and development. We present a study on the ability of CI carbonaceous asteroid regolith simulant to sustain plant growth of lettuce (Latuca sativa), radishes (Raphanus sativus), and peppers (Capsicum annuum). We tested growing the selected crops in increasing mixtures of simulant and peat moss. The results showed that each species reacted differently to each treatment and that the radishes were more affected by the treatments. Subsequent analysis showed that the simulant contains small amounts of plant-usable nutrients, despite its high pH, low cation exchange capacity, and classification as a silt-based soil. Our results indicate that the simulant is prone to compaction and crusting, leading to drought stress on the crops. Further investigations are needed to determine mitigation strategies to make CI asteroid regolith a more conducive soil. This data set derives results from the Image Analysis Photography assay with leaf area measurements. Additional data provided in the sample table includes plant height and biomass measurements as well as a thorough analysis of the substrate including pH, elemental analysis, and soil texture analysis.

Study Protocol Description	"The crops were grown in a Percival AR-66L (Percival Scientifics, Inc.) environmental growth chamber. The temperature was controlled from 19.8°C to 23.4°C and programmed to ramp up and down throughout the day to mimic outside temperature changes for optimal growth. The humidity was regulated at ∼50%–60%, while atmospheric CO2 was kept at ambient levels of the surrounding chamber. Additionally, the crops were watered every other day to field capacity with distilled water.

An array of 32 W and 14 W cool white fluorescent, as well as 25 W incandescent, lights were used to give the crops optimal light for growth and development by providing the plant with the full visible spectrum of light (white light), with light intensities reaching up to 275 μmol/m2/s, according to the manufacturer specifications. The photoperiod was 16 hr of daylight and an 8 hr nighttime cycle. Similar to that of temperature, lighting also was ramped throughout the day to mimic sunrise, midday, and sunset.

In all three experiments, crops were sown in ∼2.54 cm deep with five seeds per pot. Pots were filled with an equal volume of planting medium, as each media had different densities. In experiment A, crops were grown in the CI simulant, peat moss, and increasing combinations thereof (100% peat moss, 75% peat moss/25% simulant,..., 100% simulant). Ratios of peat moss to simulant will be denoted as peat moss: simulant (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100). For our standard control, we planted seeds in commercial topsoil with added vermiculite (9wt%/pot). The pots were arranged in a randomized complete block design. Each block contained 18 pots (3 plant species × 6 soil treatments). For experiment B, the pots were again arranged in a randomized complete block design. Each block contained 9 pots (3 species × 3 soil treatments) with 50% simulant/50% perlite (by volume), pure perlite, and commercial topsoil with 25% vermiculite/25% perlite mixture (by volume). In each pot for experiments A and B, five seeds of the three crop species were sown ∼ 2.54 cm deep in each planting medium. Lastly, for experiment C, two pots with five radish seeds each were sown ∼2.45 cm deep into 50% simulant/50% perlite mixture soil and then placed into two 2D clinostats to mimic microgravity. One clinostat was rotated once per day upright as the control, and the second was continuously rotated (1 rotation/24 hr period) 90° parallel to the ground to simulate microgravity."	Germination of the crops was recorded when first evident and breaching the top of the soil. We harvested the crops 55 days after planting (DAP), ensuring growth of the edible portion of the lettuce and radishes and the beginning of flowering of the peppers based on days to harvest descriptions from our seed packets. We washed the plants of any remaining planting medium and collected data for plant height, total biomass, and leaf area. We measured the plant height by measuring the crop from the bottom of the stem just above the roots to the leaf canopy. Then, we dried the crops at 60°C for 64 hr. Once removed from the drying oven, we weighed the biomass of above-ground greens and roots. To measure the dried leaf area, we used ImageJ by converting imaged leaves (laid onto centimeter-scale graph paper) into gray scale, adjusting the threshold so that the entire leaf was covered by a red indicator, and analyzing area to a set centimeter scale.	Quantitative soil analysis was conducted at Kansas State University Soil Testing Laboratory in Manhattan, Kansas. The soil analysis tests were conducted on all planting media used in this study. The tests conducted included analysis of nutrients (total percent Nitrogen, total percent Carbon, Aluminum, Calcium, Copper, Magnesium, Manganese, Sodium, Phosphorus, Nitrate, Ammonium, Potassium, Zinc, Iron), CEC, pH, soil texture including % sand, % silt, and % clay, and % organic matter.	To measure the dried leaf area, we used ImageJ by converting imaged leaves (laid onto centimeter-scale graph paper) into gray scale, adjusting the threshold so that the entire leaf was covered by a red indicator, and analyzing area to a set centimeter scale. See supplemental images for pictures of entire plants and pots.
