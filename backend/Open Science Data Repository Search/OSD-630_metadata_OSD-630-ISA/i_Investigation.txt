Study Identifier	OSD-630
Study Title	SpaceX Inspiration4 Stool Metagenome Profiling
Study Description	The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission was a 3-day mission with four private astronauts to low Earth orbit that occurred in September 2021. The crew collected biospecimen samples before, during, and after flight. One of these biospecimen collections included stool collected in OMNIgene•GUT tubes (DNA Genotek, OMR-200). Samples were collected pre-flight (L-92, L-44) and post-flight (R+45, R+82). This study hosts stool data. Additional skin, oral and nasal metagenome data is deposited in OSD-572. Dragon capsule data metagenome is deposited in OSD-573. Skin biopsy-site metagenome data is deposited in OSD-574.

Study Protocol Description	All subjects were consented at an informed consent briefing (ICB) at SpaceX (Hawthorne, CA), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569. All crew members have consented for data and sample sharing. We sequenced analyzed samples from human skin, oral, nasal and environmental swabs before, during, and after a 3-day mission to space.	For fecal collection, all subjects are provided with DNA Genotek OMNIgene-GUT (OM-200) kits for gut microbiome DNA collection. Each subject was instructed to empty their bladder and collect a fecal sample free of urine and toilet water. From the fecal specimen, each subject used a sterile single-use spatula, provided by the OMNIgene-GUT kit, to collect the feces and deposit it into the OMIgene-GUT tube. Once deposited and sealed, the user was instructed to shake the sealed tube for 30 seconds in order to homogenize the sample and release the storage buffer. All samples from each timepoint were stored at room temperature for less than 3 days before storing at -80°C long-term. Fecal samples collected using the OMNIgene-GUT kit are stable at room temperature (15°C to 25°C) for up to 60 days.	DNA was isolated from each sample using the QIAGEN PowerFecal ProRO DNA Kit (cat  51804). OMNIgene-GUT tubes thawed on ice (4°C) and vortexed for 10 seconds before transferring 400uL of homogenized feces into the QIAGEN PowerBead Pro Tube with 0.1mm glass beads and secured to a Vortex-Genie 2 using an adapter (cat  1300-V1-24) before being homogenized at maximum speed for 10 minutes. The remainder of the protocol was completed as instructed by the manufacturer. The concentration of the isolated DNA was measured by fluorometric quantitation using the Qubit 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat  Q33238), and the Qubit 1Xds DNA Broad Range Assay Kit was used for DNA concentration (cat  Q33265).	For shotgun metagenomic sequencing, library preparation for Illumina NGS platforms was performed using the Illumina DNA FLEX Library prep kit (cat  20018705) with IDT for Illumina DNA/RNA US Indexes (cat  20060059).	Following library preparation, quality control was assessed using a BioAnalyzer 2100 (Agilent, cat  G2939BA) and the High Sensitivity DNA assay. All libraries were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 2000 Sequencing System with 2 × 150 bp paired-end reads.	Utilizing kraken2 v2.1.1, a human genome reference database was constructed from NCBI's RefSeq (GCF_000001405.39) GRCh38.p13, with --no-masking, and defaults of kmer-length 35 and minimizer-length of 31. FASTQ files were screened against this database, and all successfully classified reads were removed.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.	Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.11. Quality-trimming and filtering was performed with bbmap v38.86. Read-based processing was performed with humann v3.6. Individual samples were assembled with megahit v1.2.9. Genes were called with prodigal v2.6.3. Taxonomic classification of genes and contigs was performed with CAT v5.2.2. Functional annotation was done with KOFamScan v1.3.0. Reads were mapped to assemblies with bowtie2 v2.3.5.1, and coverage information was extracted for reads and contigs with samtools v1.9 and bbmap v38.86. Binning of contigs was performed with metabat2 v2.15. Bins were summarized with bit v1.8.53 and estimates of quality were generated with checkm v1.1.3. High-quality bins (higher than 90% est. completeness and lower than 10% est. redundancy) were taxonomically classified with gtdb-tk v1.5.0.
